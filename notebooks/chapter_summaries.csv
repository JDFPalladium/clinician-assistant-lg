Chapter 15,"**Summary of Annex 16: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) in Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022**

- **Definition and Classification**: IRIS is an inflammatory reaction occurring in patients who have started antiretroviral therapy (ART) and experience immune system recovery. It is classified into two types: Unmasked IRIS, where a previously undiagnosed opportunistic infection (OI) appears, and Paradoxical IRIS, where a previously diagnosed disease worsens after ART initiation.
  
- **Risk Factors**: High-risk groups include patients with advanced immunosuppression (WHO Stage 3 or 4, CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm³, or CD4% ≤ 25% for children ≤ 5 years), those with diagnosed OIs like tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), low baseline CD4 count (≤ 50 cells/mm³ or CD4% ≤ 10%), and high baseline viral load.

- **Patient Evaluation**: Emphasizes history taking (symptoms, ARV history, adherence, viral load, CD4 count) and physical examination focusing on vital signs and affected systems. Screening for common OIs is recommended.

- **Diagnosis**: Suspect IRIS if clinical deterioration occurs weeks to months after ART initiation. Diagnosis is one of exclusion, ruling out drug reactions, non-adherence, active infections, or drug resistance. Presentations can be major (e.g., TB, MAC, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV retinitis) or minor (e.g., herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus).

- **Management**: Depends on severity. Mild IRIS may resolve with symptomatic treatment (NSAIDs, inhaled steroids, surgical interventions). Severe IRIS requires treating the OI and managing inflammation with corticosteroids (except in Kaposi's sarcoma-related IRIS). Monitor for side effects of corticosteroids.

- **Unique Recommendations**: Avoid corticosteroids in Kaposi's sarcoma-related IRIS. Monitor for hyperglycemia, hypertension, mental status changes, avascular necrosis, and infection risks in patients on corticosteroids.
