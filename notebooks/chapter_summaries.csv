Chapter 15,"**Summary of Annex 16: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) in Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022**

- **Definition and Classification**: IRIS is an inflammatory reaction occurring in patients who have started antiretroviral therapy (ART) and experience immune system recovery. It is classified into two types: Unmasked IRIS, where a previously undiagnosed opportunistic infection (OI) appears, and Paradoxical IRIS, where a previously diagnosed disease worsens after ART initiation.
  
- **Risk Factors**: High-risk groups include patients with advanced immunosuppression (WHO Stage 3 or 4, CD4 count â¤ 200 cells/mmÂ³, or CD4% â¤ 25% for children â¤ 5 years), those with diagnosed OIs like tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), low baseline CD4 count (â¤ 50 cells/mmÂ³ or CD4% â¤ 10%), and high baseline viral load.

- **Patient Evaluation**: Emphasizes history taking (symptoms, ARV history, adherence, viral load, CD4 count) and physical examination focusing on vital signs and affected systems. Screening for common OIs is recommended.

- **Diagnosis**: Suspect IRIS if clinical deterioration occurs weeks to months after ART initiation. Diagnosis is one of exclusion, ruling out drug reactions, non-adherence, active infections, or drug resistance. Presentations can be major (e.g., TB, MAC, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV retinitis) or minor (e.g., herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus).

- **Management**: Depends on severity. Mild IRIS may resolve with symptomatic treatment (NSAIDs, inhaled steroids, surgical interventions). Severe IRIS requires treating the OI and managing inflammation with corticosteroids (except in Kaposi's sarcoma-related IRIS). Monitor for side effects of corticosteroids.

- **Unique Recommendations**: Avoid corticosteroids in Kaposi's sarcoma-related IRIS. Monitor for hyperglycemia, hypertension, mental status changes, avascular necrosis, and infection risks in patients on corticosteroids.

This chapter is distinct in its focus on the diagnosis, risk factors, and management of IRIS, a condition that arises specifically in the context of ART and immune recovery in HIV patients."
