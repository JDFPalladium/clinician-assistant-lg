Initial Evaluation and Follow up  \n \n3.1 Introduction  \nAll PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical  stage, age, \npregnancy status, or comorbidities. ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, \npreferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis.  \nIn order to provide targeted services based on clinical presentation, during the init ial evaluation \nall PLHIV should be categorized as presenting with advanced HIV disease (AHD) or as presenting \nwell (Table 3.3). Patients with advanced disease require more intensive evaluation for and \nmanagement of OIs, and once ART is started, they are at  higher risk of developing immune \nreconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS, Annex 16).  \nSimilarly, after at least 6 months on ART, PLHIV should be categorized as being either established \nor not established on ART (clinically, virologically, and psychosoci ally) to best meet the specific \nneeds of each patient for treatment and follow -up and improve patient outcomes through provision \nof targeted differentiated care. Differentiated care minimizes inconvenience and unnecessary \nfrequent follow -up, thus reducing costs and time related to clinic visits. It also allows resources to \nbe focused on those patients who require additional attention.  \n3.2 Initial Clinical Evaluation of PLHIV  \nAll patients enrolling into HIV care should have a complete medical history taken, a thorough \nphysical examination and appropriate laboratory investigations. Findings from this initial \nevaluation should be documented legibly in a retrievable health record management format \n(electronic or paper -based) to facilitate long -term follow -up of the patient.

People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) and HIV  \n \n12.1 Introduction  \nThe use of ART for HIV treatment in key populations should follow the same general principles \nand recommendations as for all adults. Individuals within key populations groups may experience \ndiscrimination and marginali zation that can impede their access to health care, including \ntreatment for HIV, and frequently present late for treatment. It is important to ensure that people \nfrom key populations have equitable access to HIV treatment and care.  Programs should ensure \nthat missed opportunities are minimized and every single encounter with key populations is \noptimally used. ART service delivery includes decentralization of HIV care and treatment and \nintegration of ART services into other clinical services such as Medical ly Assisted Therapy and \ndrop -in centers where appropriate capacity exists.  \nPeople who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk of HIV infection. In Kenya, the HIV \nprevalence among PWID is up to 4 times that of the general population. PWID also suffer a hi gher \nburden of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV), TB and sexually transmitted infections irrespective of \ntheir HIV status. Despite this, PWID have limited access to HIV treatment and prevention services.  \nEvery effort should be made to implement evidence -inform ed interventions in the comprehensive \npackage of measures targeting PWID, either in combination or (depending on site capacity) singly, \nwith linkage to comprehensive care (Table 12.1).  \nPackage of care for PWID  \nPWID have complex needs related to drug dependency, psychosocial and medical \ncomplications of injection and other substance use. When they require ART, anti -TB, or any \nother therapy, they are at increased risk of adverse drug reactions, drug -drug interactions and \nnon-adherence.
