Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","Here is a detailed summary of the important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) based on the provided source texts:

- **Efavirenz**: 
  - Co-administration with DTG is not recommended as efavirenz decreases DTG levels.
  - If used together, increase DTG dose to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Etravirine**:
  - Co-administration is not recommended unless used with a protease inhibitor/ritonavir (PI/r), which counteracts the interaction.
  - Without PI/r, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Rifampicin**:
  - Rifampicin lowers DTG levels.
  - Increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients over 20 kg.
  - For children under 20 kg, double the weight-appropriate DTG dose.

- **Rifapentine**:
  - Potential decrease in DTG levels with once-weekly rifapentine.
  - No dose adjustment required unless viral load becomes detectable, then increase DTG to twice daily.

- **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**:
  - These drugs decrease DTG levels.
  - Avoid use if possible; if necessary, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily and monitor viral load.

- **Mineral Supplements and Antacids**:
  - Supplements containing calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum decrease DTG absorption.
  - Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements.
  - If taken with a meal, dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements.

- **Metformin**:
  - DTG increases metformin plasma levels.
  - Limit metformin dose to 1,000 mg daily and monitor glycemic control.

- **Methadone**:
  - No interaction with DTG.

- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**:
  - DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - Discuss pregnancy intentions with women initiating ART.

These interactions highlight the importance of dose adjustments and timing of administration to ensure the efficacy and safety of DTG when used with other medications.",1.0,0.9645169828191099,19.5,llm,gpt-4o
How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

- **Indications for PrEP**:
  - PrEP is recommended for HIV-uninfected individuals at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition.
  - Risk factors include having an HIV-positive partner not on ART or with poor adherence, engaging in transactional sex, having a history of STIs, inconsistent condom use, and sharing needles.

- **Eligibility Criteria**:
  - Confirmed HIV-negative status through testing.
  - Willingness to adhere to the PrEP regimen.
  - No recent illness consistent with acute HIV infection.
  - No contraindications to the ARVs used in PrEP.
  - Assessment of renal and liver function if there is a history of related diseases.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Conduct a thorough HIV risk assessment using screening questions about sexual behavior, drug use, and exposure to violence.
  - Screen for gender-based violence and mental health issues that may affect adherence.

- **Client Education**:
  - Explain how PrEP works as part of combination HIV prevention.
  - Discuss the need for regular HIV testing and follow-up.
  - Educate on PrEP use, including medication types, dosing frequency, and what to do if doses are missed.
  - Discuss the limitations of PrEP, including that it does not prevent STIs or pregnancy.
  - Provide risk reduction counseling, including mental health support, access to condoms, and STI screening.

- **Recommended ARVs for PrEP**:
  - The preferred regimen is Tenofovir 300mg/Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) as a fixed-dose combination tablet taken daily.
  - Alternative regimens and dosing strategies, such as event-driven PrEP, are available but primarily recommended for individuals born male.

- **Long-acting Products**:
  - Long-acting options like Cabotegravir injections and Dapivirine vaginal rings are in various stages of approval and may be considered when available.

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['Note that certain patient groups e.g., recent HIV infections, pregnant adolescent girls and young women, women with previous children with HIV infection, patients with high viral load at time of pregnancy confirmation, patients with poor social support systems, patients with history of default from care and those with active co-morbidities etc. may require additional adherence and psychosocial support\n\n# 7.2. Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive for syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and ensure they are treated for syphilis.\n\nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after birth.\n\n# 7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).\n\nRefer to Chapter 9 for management of HIV/HBV coinfection.\n\n\n\n# Table 7.3: ARV Prophylaxis for HIV-Exposed Infants\n\n| Infant Scenario    | Infant Prophylaxis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maternal Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| HIV Exposed Infant | * Infant prophylaxis\n\n  * AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP + cotrimoxazole should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding\n  * Infant prophylaxis can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP if the child is not breastfeeding (death of mother or separation with mother)\n  * The infant prophylaxis regimen applies to all infants irrespective of age when identifying HIV exposure (e.g., mother diagnosed HIV-positive in the postpartum period)\n\n* DBS or whole blood for PCR at 6 weeks or first contact, following EID algorithm (Figure 2.1)\n\n* Birth testing (Figure 2.2) may be conducted in sites where point of care has been implemented and when medically indicated | - If mother not on ART, initiate ART as soon as possible (preferably same day)\n- If mother is on ART for ≥ 3 months and the VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, intensify adherence, repeat the VL\n- If VL <50 copies/ml, continue current regimen\n- Follow Viral load algorithm Figure 6.6 |', '## TRIPLE ELIMINATION\n\n| CONDITION in mother                      | INFANT MANAGEMENT                                                                                                                      | MATERNAL MANAGEMENT                                                                                  |\n| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Syphilis-VDRL or diagnosed with Dual kit | Crystalline Penicillin 50,000 IU/kg BD (if <7 days) or TDS if (>7 days old) for a total of 10 days.                                    | Penicillin G 2.4 MU IM Stat or Ceftriaxone 1gm IM daily for 8-10 days in case of penicillin allergy. |\n| Congenital syphilis                      |                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                      |\n| Hepatitis B – HbsAg test                 | Hepatitis B immunoglobulin 0.5ml IM within 12 hours after birth.

- **Indication for Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis:**
  - Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is indicated for HIV-exposed infants.
  - It should be continued until 6 weeks after the complete cessation of breastfeeding.
  - If the infant is not breastfeeding (e.g., due to the death of the mother or separation), cotrimoxazole can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP.

- **Infant Prophylaxis Regimen:**
  - For HIV-exposed infants, the prophylaxis regimen includes AZT+NVP for 6 weeks.
  - If the infant cannot tolerate NVP or AZT, the tolerated drug should be given until the complete cessation of breastfeeding.
  - In cases where neither AZT nor NVP is tolerated, 3TC may be used as a third option if available.

- **Special Considerations:**
  - HIV-exposed infants with TB infection should receive AZT plus 3TC fixed dose for 12 weeks or until maternal viral load is suppressed.
  - After TB treatment, revert to NVP until 6 weeks post-cessation of breastfeeding.
  - HB monitoring is recommended for all HIV-exposed infants on AZT prophylaxis to manage potential bone marrow suppression.

- **Higher Risk Groups for Mother to Child Transmission:**
  - New HIV positives, HIV positive adolescent girls and young women, and those with a viral load >200 copies/ml.
  - Clients with stigma, declining treatment, poor adherence, or previous HIV-infected infants.
  - Clients with active comorbidities, poor socio-economic and family support, or those who drop off ART.
  - Key populations such as female sex workers and people who inject drugs.

These points highlight the importance of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in preventing opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed infants and the need for tailored management in higher-risk groups.",0.8,0.9033877722691348,27.06,llm,gpt-4o
What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding ART failure from the provided source texts:

- **Definition and Causes of Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure occurs when ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it.
  - Resistance can develop if ART is not taken correctly, or if medications are started and stopped multiple times.
  - Treatment failure is suspected when a viral load (VL) is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART use.
  - Treatment failure is confirmed when VL remains ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after addressing adherence issues or other reasons for high VL.

- **Consequences of Treatment Failure:**
  - If ART fails, stronger and more expensive ART regimens may be required, which might not work as effectively.
  - Stronger ART regimens may involve taking more pills daily and experiencing more side effects.
  - If resistance develops to the new ART regimen, there may be no effective drugs available, leading to rapid viral increase and a significant drop in CD4 count.

- **Importance of Adherence:**
  - Adherence to ART is crucial to prevent treatment failure and resistance.
  - Patients should follow their care plan, attend clinic appointments, and take medications as prescribed.
  - Missing doses or incorrect dosing can lead to resistance and treatment failure.
  - Adherence support should be tailored to the patient's needs and monitored continuously, even with viral suppression.

- **Management of Treatment Failure:**
  - Before changing ART regimens, the reasons for treatment failure should be identified and addressed urgently using a case-management approach.
  - Adherence monitoring, counseling, and support should continue despite viral suppression to prevent new or worsening barriers to adherence.

- **General ART Guidelines:**
  - ART aims to suppress viral replication to undetectable levels (VL < 50 copies/ml).
  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of CD4 count or other criteria, if they are willing and ready to start.
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, preferably within 2 weeks.

These points highlight the critical aspects of managing ART failure and emphasize the importance of adherence to prevent resistance and ensure effective treatment.",1.0,0.9444586654285284,23.79,llm,gpt-4o
How do you manage HIV in pregnancy?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

  - ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 cell count, and continued lifelong.
  - Ideally, ART should start on the same day as HIV diagnosis after a readiness assessment, with ongoing enhanced adherence support.
  - The recommended first-line ART regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG.

- **Infant Prophylaxis:**
  - Infants should receive AZT+NVP for 6 weeks.
  - NVP should continue until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - Use same-day point-of-care methods for viral load testing whenever possible to expedite results and clinical decision-making.
  - For newly initiated ART, obtain viral load (VL) 3 months after initiation, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For women already on ART, obtain VL irrespective of prior VL timing, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - If VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, assess and address potential reasons for viremia, intensify adherence support, and repeat VL after 3 months.
    - If repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.
    - If repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen.
    - If repeat VL is < 200 copies/ml, continue routine monitoring.

- **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):**
  - Integrate PMTCT into routine antenatal care (ANC) with health education, HIV testing, and linkage to prevention and treatment.
  - Provide comprehensive ANC services, including health checks, medical tests (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B), and monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing.
  - Offer information on birth preparedness, skilled birth attendance, and post-natal care, including immunization and family planning.

- **Counseling and Education:**
  - Conduct pregnancy intention assessments for HIV-positive women of reproductive age.
  - Provide intensive adherence counseling and HIV education for newly diagnosed women or those initiating ART.
  - Support birth preparedness with individual birth plans, emergency transport, and readiness for infant care.
  - Educate on pregnancy danger signs and encourage prompt ANC visits if symptoms develop.
  - Promote maternal, infant, and young child nutrition (MIYCN), including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, followed by complementary feeding.",1.0,0.8992098768065553,20.96,llm,gpt-4o

What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed.

- **PrEP Overview:**
  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves using antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection in individuals at risk.
  - PrEP is recommended for all individuals at risk, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

- **PrEP Regimens:**
  - **Daily Oral PrEP:**
    - Recommended for all individuals at risk, including men who have sex with men.
    - Preferred regimen: Tenofovir 300mg/Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet taken once daily.
    - Alternative regimen: Tenofovir 300mg/Lamivudine 300mg (TDF/3TC) as FDC once daily.
  - **Event-Driven (ED) PrEP:**
    - Recommended for men who have sex with men who are not on exogenous estradiol-based gender-affirming hormones.
    - Preferred regimen: TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg) as FDC – two pills taken between 2 and 24 hours before anticipated sex, followed by a third pill 24 hours after the first two pills, and a fourth pill 48 hours after the first two pills (2-1-1 dosing strategy).
    - Alternative regimen: TDF/3TC (300 mg/300 mg) as FDC with the same 2-1-1 dosing strategy.

- **Eligibility and Risk Assessment:**
  - PrEP is indicated for HIV-uninfected individuals at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition.
  - Risk factors include having an HIV-positive partner not on ART or with poor adherence, engaging in transactional sex, having a history of STIs, inconsistent condom use, and sharing needles.
  - Eligibility requires confirmed HIV-negative status, willingness to adhere to PrEP, absence of acute HIV symptoms, and no contraindications to ARVs.

- **Client Education and Support:**
  - Clients should be educated on how PrEP works, the need for regular HIV testing, and the importance of adherence.
  - Discuss potential side effects, limitations of PrEP (it does not prevent STIs or pregnancy), and risk reduction strategies.
  - Mental health and gender-based violence screenings are important to support adherence and overall well-being.

- **Long-acting PrEP Options:**
  - Long-acting products like Cabotegravir injections and Dapivirine vaginal rings are in various stages of approval and may become available as additional options in the future.",0.9375,0.9999999999999992,22.03,llm,gpt-4o

- **Initial Monitoring:**
  - Viral load is measured at the start of ART for PCR-positive HIV-exposed infants (HEIs).
  - For all patients, viral load is measured at 3 months after starting ART.

- **Routine Monitoring:**
  - **Ages 0-24 years:** After the initial 3-month measurement, viral load is monitored every 6 months.
  - **Ages ≥ 25 years:** After the initial 3-month measurement, viral load is monitored at 12 months, and then annually if the viral load is suppressed.
  - **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:**
    - If already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy, viral load is measured at confirmation of pregnancy and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
    - If starting ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding, viral load is measured 3 months after initiation and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.

- **Special Circumstances:**
  - Before any drug substitution for patients on ART for at least 6 months with no valid viral load, a viral load test is required.
  - At 3 months after any regimen modification, viral load is measured, and then as per the population group guidelines.
  - If a patient has a detectable viral load during routine monitoring, follow the viral load monitoring algorithm for further action.

- **Understanding Viral Load Results:**
  - An undetectable viral load after 3 months of treatment indicates effective ART, but it does not mean the patient is no longer infected with HIV.
  - A detectable viral load suggests treatment issues, often due to missed doses, and requires collaboration with the clinic team to address the problem.

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the preferred first-line regimen for adults from the provided source texts:

- **Preferred First-Line ART Regimen for Adults:**
  - For adults (≥ 15 years old), the preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is a combination of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and Dolutegravir (DTG).
  - The dosing for this regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tablet once daily.

- **General ART Guidelines:**
  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, or risk group, as long as they are willing and ready to start ART.
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally on the same day or within two weeks.

- **Adherence and Monitoring:**
  - Adherence preparation, monitoring, and support should be tailored to the patient's level of adherence and stage of ART initiation and follow-up.
  - Patients with durable viral suppression should receive messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).
  - Adherence monitoring, counseling, and support should continue even if the patient has achieved viral suppression, as new or worsening barriers to adherence can occur.

- **Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months on ART.
  - Treatment failure is confirmed if VL remains ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing adherence issues or other reasons for high VL.

- **Transition to Preferred Regimen:**
  - Patients, including children and adolescents, who are virally suppressed but not on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed and transitioned to the preferred regimen if appropriate.",1.0,0.9468891464386591,16.95,llm,gpt-4o
Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

If this is not available, viral load specimens and results for pregnant and breastfeeding women should be given priority across the laboratory referral process (including specimen collection, testing and return of results).\n\n* For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n* For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy or breastfeeding, obtain a VL irrespective of when prior VL was done, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n* For pregnant or breastfeeding women with a VL ≥ 50 copies/ml: assess for and address potential reasons for viremia, including intensifying adherence support, repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence, including daily witnessed ingestion, where feasible and appropriate\n\n  * If the repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG\n  * If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen. Refer to Table 6.10\n  * If the repeat VL is < 200 copies/ml (LDL) then continue routine |"", '# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","- **Use of Dolutegravir (DTG) in Pregnancy:**
  - DTG is considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - It is recommended as part of the first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, specifically in combination with tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC).

- **Initiation and Continuation of ART:**
  - ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 cell count, and continued lifelong.
  - Ideally, ART should be started on the same day as HIV diagnosis after a readiness assessment, with ongoing adherence support.

- **Monitoring During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**
  - Viral load (VL) monitoring is crucial during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - For newly initiated ART, VL should be checked 3 months after initiation and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For those already on ART, VL should be checked irrespective of prior testing and then every 6 months.

- **Management of Viremia:**
  - If VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, assess and address potential reasons for viremia, intensify adherence support, and repeat VL after 3 months.
  - If repeat VL is 200-999 copies/ml, consult with HIV Clinical TWG.
  - If repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen.

- **Drug Interactions with DTG:**
  - Rifampicin lowers DTG levels; increase DTG dosage when co-administered.
  - Mineral supplements and antacids can decrease DTG absorption; administer DTG 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements.
  - DTG increases metformin levels; adjust metformin dosage accordingly.

- **Regimen Optimization:**
  - DTG is preferred for its superior tolerability and efficacy compared to other ARVs like efavirenz and lopinavir.
  - Regimen modifications may be necessary for age/weight transitions and to prevent long-term toxicity.

- **Patient Education:**
  - Discuss pregnancy intentions with women initiating ART and offer family planning counseling if needed.
  - Educate patients about potential drug interactions, especially with over-the-counter supplements and antacids.",1.0,0.913130675974582,25.73,llm,gpt-4o

TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the management of HIV in tuberculosis (TB) coinfection based on the provided source texts:

- **General Management:**
  - All people living with HIV (PLHIV) diagnosed with TB should be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) as part of their comprehensive care.
  - Close monitoring for toxicity and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is essential.

- **Timing of ART Initiation:**
  - **For Patients Not Yet on ART:**
    - Start TB treatment immediately.
    - Initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks.
    - For TB meningitis, delay ART initiation for 4 to 8 weeks.
  - **For Patients Already on ART:**
    - Continue ART while starting TB treatment immediately.
    - Assess for treatment failure and adjust ART regimen as needed due to drug-drug interactions.

- **Preferred ART Regimens:**
  - **Newly Initiating 1st Line ART:**
    - **Birth to 4 weeks:** Start anti-TB treatment immediately; initiate ART after 4 weeks of age.
    - **>4 weeks to <15 years (<30 kg):** Use ABC + 3TC + DTG, with increased DTG dosing frequency during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.
    - **≥30 kg and ≥15 years:** Use TDF/3TC/DTG FDC with additional DTG dosing during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.
  - **Patients Developing TB While Virally Suppressed on 1st Line ART:**
    - **PI/r-based Regimen:** Switch to DTG or adjust PI/r dosing with ritonavir super-boosting.
    - **RAL-based Regimen:** Switch to double-dose DTG during TB treatment.
    - **DTG-based Regimen:** Administer double-dose DTG during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.

- **TB Screening and Prevention:**
  - TB screening should be conducted at every clinical visit using the Intensified Case Finding (ICF) tool.
  - Patients screening positive for TB symptoms should undergo definitive diagnostic testing.
  - Patients screening negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).
  - Healthcare settings should implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce transmission risk.

- **Counseling and Education:**
  - PLHIV should receive counseling on TB risk, exposure reduction strategies, symptom recognition, and the importance of seeking care promptly.
  - Education on TB transmission risks and preventive therapy is crucial.

- **Special Considerations:**

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points from the provided source texts:

- **CD4 Cell Count:**
  - Essential for all patients to assess immune function.
  - Used to diagnose Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) if CD4 < 200 cells/mm³.
  - For children ≤ 5 years, CD4% is used.
  - If CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³, additional tests like serum cryptococcal antigen (sCrAg) and TB-LAM should be conducted.

- **Viral Load (HIV-1 RNA):**
  - Baseline viral load is recommended, especially for infants after a positive PCR test.
  - Important for monitoring treatment efficacy and detecting treatment failure.

- **Serum Cryptococcal Antigen (sCrAg):**
  - Conducted if CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³ to screen for cryptococcal infection.
  - Reflex testing by the laboratory is recommended.

- **Hemoglobin (Hb) or Full Blood Count:**
  - Recommended for all patients, especially those on AZT (Zidovudine).

- **Creatinine:**
  - Important for all patients, particularly those starting Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF).
  - Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) should be calculated.

- **Urinalysis (for protein & glucose):**
  - Recommended for all patients to monitor kidney function and glucose levels.

- **Plasma Lipid Profile and Glucose:**
  - Conducted for all patients to monitor metabolic side effects of ART.

- **Syphilis Serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR):**
  - Recommended for all sexually active patients to screen for syphilis.

- **Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C Antibody:**
  - HBsAg for all adolescents and adults, and children who missed routine immunizations.
  - HCV antibody for patients with a history of injection drug use.

- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):**
  - Not routinely recommended unless there is a clinical indication such as liver disease risk.

- **HPV Testing:**
  - For women aged 25-49, conducted at baseline and every two years.

- **Pregnancy Test:**
  - For women of reproductive age to determine pregnancy status.

- **TB-LAM:**
  - Conducted on urine samples if CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³ in patients >5 years or CD4% ≤ 25% in children <5 years, especially if seriously ill.

- **Management of Advanced HIV Disease (AHD):**
  - Includes timely ART initiation, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.

- **Facilities and Testing Capacity:**
  - Not all facilities can offer all tests; arrangements should be made to transport specimens to reference laboratories if needed.

These tests are crucial for monitoring the effectiveness of ART, managing side effects, and preventing opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS.",1.0,0.9280831628567965,34.01,llm,gpt-4o
When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the initiation of second-line ART based on the provided source texts:

- **General Guidelines for Second-line ART Initiation:**
  - Second-line ART is initiated when a patient fails a first-line regimen, confirmed by a Drug Resistance Test (DRT).
  - Non-adherence is the most common cause of treatment failure; adherence issues must be addressed before confirming treatment failure.
  - Daily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to ensure excellent adherence before repeating the viral load (VL) test.
  - If a drug in the recommended second-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG for guidance.

- **Specific Considerations for Different Patient Groups:**
  - **Infants and Children:**
    - Second-line ART management is complex and requires thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment.
    - Discuss treatment changes in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) setting with an experienced ART provider.
    - Limited options for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen; consultation with the HIV Clinical TWG may be necessary.
  - **Adults and Adolescents:**
    - For those ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old, second-line ART is typically DRT-based.
    - Pregnant and breastfeeding women should have a sample taken for DRT and may be switched to a regimen like TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting results.

- **Second-line ART Treatment Failure:**
  - Confirm treatment failure with viral load testing following the monitoring algorithm.
  - Address all causes of poor adherence and other possible causes of viremia before confirming failure.
  - If viremia persists after adherence support, consult the HIV Clinical TWG for guidance on third-line regimens.
  - Patients failing second-line ART require enhanced adherence support, including frequent counseling and mental health assessments.

- **Regimen Adjustments:**
  - If the regimen itself causes poor adherence due to side effects, it may need modification in consultation with the HIV Clinical TWG.
  - Specific regimens are recommended based on weight, age, and specific conditions like pregnancy or co-infections.

- **Additional Support and Resources:**
  - Use the Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) and the national case summary form for consultations with the HIV Clinical TWG.
  - Enhanced adherence support includes assigning a case manager and more frequent counseling sessions.",1.0,0.913401561276408,22.78,llm,gpt-4o
What adherence strategies are recommended?,"['# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.']","Here is a detailed summary of the recommended adherence strategies for HIV/AIDS treatment based on the provided source texts:

- **Adherence Preparation and Support:**
  - Begin adherence-enhancing strategies at the point of HIV diagnosis, continuing through initial evaluation and follow-up.
  - Tailor adherence preparation, monitoring, and support to the patient's level of adherence, stage of ART initiation, and follow-up stage.
  - Ensure follow-up is provided by the same care provider or team to maintain consistency, especially in the first few months of care.

- **Adherence Monitoring Strategies:**
  - **Subjective Monitoring:**
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 at every visit to assess adherence.
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 when adherence problems are suspected.
  - **Objective Monitoring:**
    - Conduct pill counts at every visit until viral suppression is confirmed and whenever adherence issues are suspected.
    - Review pharmacy refill records at every drug pick-up and when adherence problems are suspected.
    - Monitor viral load following the viral load monitoring algorithm to confirm adherence.

- **Adherence Support Techniques:**
  - Conduct home visits to understand the patient's living situation and specific barriers to adherence, with prior consent.
  - Develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients to accurately assess adherence.
  - Train all providers in assessing adherence and providing support, with referrals to specialized providers for patients with significant challenges.

- **Enhanced Support for Complex Cases:**
  - Refer patients with significant adherence challenges to providers with additional training for dedicated support.
  - Involve experienced colleagues and discuss complex cases with the multidisciplinary team (MDT) to find solutions.
  - Consult with Mental Health Teams or regional/national mentors for complex situations.

- **Initial and Ongoing Education:**
  - Provide HIV education and adherence preparation at enrolment visits.
  - Conduct ART readiness assessments and develop individualized adherence support plans.
  - Schedule follow-up appointments to review adherence and side effects, especially in the initial weeks of ART.

These strategies emphasize the importance of early and continuous adherence support, tailored interventions, and a collaborative approach to managing HIV/AIDS treatment.",1.0,0.93757242107593,34.26,llm,gpt-4o

- **Dietary Considerations:**
  - Preferably taken on an empty stomach.
  - Can be taken with food, but high-fat meals should be avoided as they increase absorption.

- **Major Side Effects:**
  - Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms: somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia, etc.
  - Skin rash.
  - Avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy.
  - Avoid in patients with a history of psychiatric disease due to potential exacerbation of symptoms.

- **Drug-Drug Interactions:**
  - **Antiretrovirals:**
    - Co-administration with dolutegravir (DTG) is not recommended as EFV decreases DTG levels. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
    - Co-administration with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) is not recommended as EFV decreases ATV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.
    - Avoid combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) due to increased risk of prolonged-QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death.
    - Co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) is not recommended as DRV/r may increase EFV levels, leading to toxicity, and EFV decreases DRV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.

  - **Antifungals:**
    - Combination with voriconazole is not recommended as EFV increases voriconazole levels by 44% and decreases voriconazole levels by 77%.

  - **Anti-Mycobacterials:**
    - When used with rifampicin, EFV levels decrease by 25%. Consider increasing EFV dose to 800 mg daily.

  - **Oral Contraceptives:**
    - EFV decreases levels of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 37%. Use alternative or additional contraceptive methods.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Can be used with rifampicin in tuberculosis (TB) patients, but careful monitoring is required.

Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival.

  - Source 1 outlines potential third-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for children, adolescents, and adults, which include combinations of multiple drugs. However, it does mention a two-drug regimen for adults: DTG (Dolutegravir) + 3TC (Lamivudine).
  - This two-drug regimen (DTG + 3TC) is listed as a possible option for adults, indicating that it can be considered in certain circumstances.

- **General ART Guidelines:**
  - ART is essential for managing HIV but does not cure the infection. The primary goal is to suppress viral replication to undetectable levels, which helps prevent immune system damage, reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, and lower the risk of HIV transmission.
  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of CD4 count, clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, co-infection status, or risk group.

- **Timing of ART Initiation:**
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, ideally within two weeks, and even on the same day if the patient is ready.
  - Special considerations for timing include immediate initiation for pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, and patients with strong motivation to start ART.
  - For patients with newly diagnosed TB, ART should begin as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within two weeks, except in cases of TB meningitis where ART is delayed for 4 to 8 weeks.
  - ART initiation may be deferred in patients with cryptococcal meningitis until after completing 5 weeks of treatment.

- **Adherence and Support:**
  - Intensive adherence counseling and support are crucial, especially for populations with limited preparation time, such as pregnant women and infants.
  - Additional support systems should be implemented for patients with challenging adherence issues, such as those with mental illness or substance use disorders.",0.9130434782608695,0.8839502633684221,18.88,llm,gpt-4o
How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.']","To handle treatment failure in HIV/AIDS management, consider the following key points from the provided source texts:

- **Understanding Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure occurs when ART (antiretroviral therapy) no longer works because the virus has become resistant.
  - Resistance can develop from not taking ART correctly, starting and stopping medications, or missing doses.
  - When resistance occurs, stronger and more expensive ART may be required, which might not be as effective and could have more side effects.

- **Consequences of Treatment Failure:**
  - The virus can increase rapidly, reducing CD4 count and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections.
  - If resistance develops to the new ART, options may become limited, leading to rapid viral increase and significant health deterioration.

- **Importance of Adherence:**
  - Adherence involves taking ART as prescribed, attending clinic appointments, and following care plans.
  - Correct dosage and timing are crucial to prevent resistance and treatment failure.
  - Enhanced adherence counseling is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure.

- **Enhanced Adherence Counseling:**
  - Assess the patient's understanding of viral load and reasons for high viral load.
  - Discuss potential barriers to adherence, including cognitive and behavioral factors.
  - Explore the patient's daily routine to ensure medication timing is appropriate.
  - Encourage the use of reminder tools and planning for travel to maintain adherence.
  - Address any side effects and how they are managed, as they can impact adherence.

- **Addressing Barriers:**
  - Identify cognitive barriers by assessing the patient's knowledge about HIV, ART, and the importance of adherence.
  - Review behavioral barriers by discussing how the patient incorporates ART into their daily routine and addressing any issues with timing or side effects.
  - Encourage open communication about any difficulties, including substance use, that may affect adherence.

By focusing on these areas, healthcare providers can better manage treatment failure and support patients in maintaining effective ART regimens.",0.9523809523809523,0.8989888527344211,17.72,llm,gpt-4o

Pharmacovigilance is particularly important for monitoring ADRs associated with any new ARVs that enter the national supply chain, as rare ADRs may appear in routine care, which were not observed in the highly selected patients participating in clinical trials.\n\nThe most common significant ADRs associated with ARVs that may require a drug substitution']","- **Pre-Initiation and Initiation of 3rd Line ART:**
  - Confirm the prescribed 3rd line ARV regimen, its availability, and management plan.
  - Assign a case manager to the patient.
  - Conduct triage, record vital signs, and provide necessary actions.
  - Offer adherence support and patient education on the new ART regimen, including treatment goals, dosing, drug interactions, and potential side effects.
  - Conduct adherence assessment and counseling, linking patients to adherence support systems.
  - Perform a clinical assessment, including history taking and physical examination.
  - Manage co-infections and co-morbidities, review potential drug interactions, and reinforce patient education.
  - Prescribe the new regimen for 2 weeks, ensuring dosing is appropriate for weight (for patients ≤15 years).
  - Dispense 3rd line ARVs for 2 weeks and conduct medication use counseling.
  - Plan for community follow-up, linking patients to support groups and planning home visits as needed.

- **Patient Follow-Up After Treatment Initiation:**
  - Conduct the first follow-up within 2 weeks of initiation, with subsequent visits monthly until confirmed viral suppression at 6 months.
  - Reinforce adherence during every clinic visit and address knowledge deficits on the new regimen.
  - Conduct clinical assessments, manage co-infections, evaluate drug interactions, and manage side effects.
  - Conduct viral load testing 3 months after regimen change.
  - Continue community follow-up and support systems.

- **Switching Regimens for Children and Adolescents:**
  - For those on a first-line ART regimen other than TDF/3TC/DTG, switch to TDF/3TC/DTG if viral load (VL) is ≥ 200 copies/ml, while assessing reasons for viremia and providing enhanced adherence counseling.
  - Schedule clinical appointments 2 weeks after regimen change to review adherence and side effects.
  - Repeat VL 3 months after regimen modification and consult regional or national TWG if VL remains ≥ 200 copies/ml.

- **Changing ARVs Due to Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs):**
  - Educate patients on potential side effects of ART and other medications.
  - Identify and manage ADRs aggressively to maintain adherence.
  - Report all ADRs to the Pharmacy and Poisons Board using pharmacovigilance tools.
  - Monitor for rare ADRs associated with new ARVs in the national supply chain.",1.0,0.802879565801482,23.27,llm,gpt-4o

Use “super-boosted” LPV/r by adding additional ritonavir to manage the drug interaction between LPV/r and rifampicin (see Annex 10 for dosing recommendations). Two weeks after TB treatment is completed the child should go back to standard LPV/r dosing.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","- **Role of Resistance Testing:**
  - Resistance testing is crucial in managing HIV treatment, particularly when there is treatment failure or when a change in regimen is necessary.
  - It helps identify if the virus has become resistant to the current ART regimen, which is a key factor in treatment failure.
  - Resistance testing guides the selection of a new, effective ART regimen when the current one fails due to resistance.
  - It is essential to consult with specialized teams, such as the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG, for guidance on resistance testing and regimen adjustments.
  - Urgent collection of drug resistance testing (DRT) samples may be necessary in certain cases, and guidance can be sought from the TWG.

- **Importance of Adherence:**
  - Adherence to ART is critical to prevent the development of resistance.
  - Inconsistent adherence, such as missing doses or incorrect dosing, increases the risk of the virus becoming resistant to ART.
  - Proper adherence involves taking the correct dosage at the right time and following any dietary restrictions associated with the medication.
  - Adherence ensures the effectiveness of ART and helps maintain a low viral load, preventing treatment failure.

- **Consequences of Resistance and Treatment Failure:**
  - When resistance occurs, the current ART regimen becomes ineffective, leading to treatment failure.
  - Treatment failure necessitates the use of stronger, potentially more expensive ART regimens, which may have more side effects and require taking more pills.
  - If resistance develops to the new ART regimen, options for effective treatment become limited, posing a significant risk to the patient's health.

- **Managing Side Effects:**
  - Side effects from ART can vary, and while some are mild and manageable, others may require immediate medical attention.
  - Patients are advised to continue taking ART despite mild side effects and consult with their clinician.
  - Severe side effects should prompt immediate consultation with healthcare providers to adjust treatment as necessary.",0.7619047619047619,0.9229164225913232,21.16,llm,gpt-4o

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","- Efavirenz:

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

- Daily Oral PrEP is recommended for all individuals at risk of HIV infection, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is recommended for individuals born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones.
- PrEP is indicated for individuals at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition, including those in sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive, engaging in transactional sex, with a history of sexually transmitted infections, or using injection drugs.
- Clients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk using a Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) before initiating PrEP.
- To be eligible for PrEP, individuals must have confirmed HIV negative status, be willing to adhere to the regimen, not have contraindications to the recommended ARVs, and not have acute HIV infection.
- Prior to PrEP initiation, clients should receive education on how PrEP works, the need for baseline and follow-up tests, PrEP use, limitations of PrEP, and risk reduction counseling.
- The preferred ARV regimen for PrEP is Tenofovir 300mg/ Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) given as one fixed dose combination tablet orally daily.

Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen.

Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","- ART failure occurs when the virus becomes resistant to the medication, leading to the need for stronger, more expensive ART that may not work as well.
- Resistance can occur by not taking ART correctly or by starting and stopping medications multiple times.
- Treatment failure can result in the need for more pills daily and increased side effects.
- If resistance occurs to the new ART as well, there may not be any effective drugs left to treat the virus.
- It is crucial to take ART as prescribed to avoid treatment failure and maintain a healthy life.
- Side effects of ART can vary from person to person and may include headaches, loss of appetite, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pains.
- If experiencing side effects, continue taking ART as prescribed and discuss with the clinician at the next appointment.
- Severe side effects should prompt immediate discussion with the clinician or a visit to the clinic.
- Adherence to ART is essential, including taking the correct dosage, taking ART at the correct time of day, and following dietary restrictions.
- Adherence monitoring, counseling, and support should continue despite viral suppression to address any barriers to adherence.
- In patients failing ART, the reason for treatment failure should be identified and addressed urgently before changing regimens.",1.0,0.9145771542316171,10.73,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

When should infants start ART?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","- Infants should start ART as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).
- Preferred first-line ART for infants includes AZT + 3TC + NVP for those birth to 4 weeks old.
- For infants over 4 weeks to less than 15 years old, ABC + 3TC + DTG is preferred for those weighing less than 30 kg, while TDF + 3TC + DTG is preferred for those weighing 30 kg or more.
- Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role in administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing challenges such as drug palatability.
- Caregivers should be shown and asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs at the time of prescribing and dispensing the ART.

What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","- Preferred first-line ART regimen for adults includes TDF + 3TC + DTG

Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '## 8.4.

- Timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in combination with TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.
- All PLHIV should receive counseling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB, and seeking care promptly.
- Healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB.
- Intensified Case Finding (ICF) screening should be performed at every clinic visit for PLHIV to rule out active TB.
- The intensified case finding screening questions include cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and contact with a TB case.
- Patients with TB/HIV co-infection should be on ART and Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) as part of comprehensive care.
- Timing of ART for TB/HIV co-infection involves starting TB treatment immediately and initiating ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated.
- Preferred ART regimens for patients with TB/HIV co-infection are summarized in tables based on age and weight categories.

All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","- Second-line ART should be initiated if any drug in the recommended first-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated

What adherence strategies are recommended?,"['# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.']","- Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented from the point of HIV diagnosis and continued throughout the follow-up period for ART.
- Adherence support strategy should be in place before ART initiation to prevent treatment failure and the need to switch to 2nd or 3rd line ART.
- Adherence preparation should begin at the time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.
- Adherence strategies should be tailored to the patient's level of adherence, stage of ART initiation, and follow-up stage.
- Follow-up should ideally be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers at each visit, especially during the first few months of HIV care.
- Adherence monitoring strategies include subjective (self-reported adherence) methods such as the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 and -8, as well as objective methods like pill counts, pharmacy refill records, and viral load monitoring.
- Assessing adherence may involve observing how a patient stores and takes their medications, conducting home visits, and developing a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients.
- Providers should regularly ask about adherence in an open and inquisitive manner to accurately assess adherence.
- Training should be provided to all providers in ART service delivery points to assess adherence and provide support, with referrals to providers with additional training for patients with significant adherence challenges.",1.0,0.9158815367034295,20.69,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

- The recommended dose for adults is 600mg once daily, preferably taken at bedtime.
- It is best taken on an empty stomach, but can be taken with food, avoiding high-fat meals that increase absorption.
- Major side effects include CNS symptoms (somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia), skin rash, and should be avoided during the first trimester.
- Efavirenz can be used with rifampicin in TB patients.
- Contraindications include a history of psychiatric disease and the first trimester of pregnancy.
- Efavirenz decreases the plasma levels of dolutegravir, so co-administration is not recommended unless the dose of dolutegravir is increased to 50mg twice daily.
- Efavirenz decreases the serum concentration of atazanavir/ritonavir, leading to resistance and treatment failure, so co-administration is not recommended.",1.0,0.8910658550986067,16.84,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
Can HIV be managed with a two-drug regimen?,"['# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', 'The general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co-infected patients initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n## B. Recommended first-line ART in HIV/HBV co-infection\n\n> The recommended first-line ART in adolescents and adults with HIV/HBV co-infection is TDF + 3TC + DTG, including for women and adolescent girls of childbearing potential\n\nTreatment with both TDF (or TAF) and 3TC is recommended as 3TC without TDF or TAF will result in rapid emergence of resistance.

- Recommended dosing of DTG includes weight-based dosing for patients under 20 kg and a 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily for patients over 20 kg. Patients taking rifampicin should increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.
- Common side effects of DTG include headache, nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. Patients should be informed about these side effects, encouraged to continue ART, and consult a healthcare worker if concerned.
- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels, but this does not indicate a true decline in renal function. Integrase inhibitors like DTG are associated with increased weight gain.
- For HIV/HBV co-infected patients, the recommended first-line ART regimen is TDF + 3TC + DTG. Treatment with both TDF and 3TC is crucial to prevent resistance.
- Closer monitoring of liver function (ALT) is advised for HBV positive patients due to the higher risk of hepatotoxicity.
- Dose adjustments for TDF and 3TC should be made in patients with impaired renal function based on creatinine clearance levels. TDF dosing may need to be adjusted for patients with renal impairment or those undergoing hemodialysis.",1.0,0.8490175045135001,8.79,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions.

- Follow-up after treatment initiation should occur within 2 weeks and then monthly until confirmed viral suppression at 6 months, with subsequent visits every 1-3 months.
- Adherence support should be reinforced during every clinic visit, with enhanced counselling sessions and addressing knowledge deficits on the new regimen.
- Clinical assessment should include history, physical examination, managing co-infections and co-morbidities, evaluating for drug interactions, managing side effects, and conducting adherence assessments.
- Viral load should be conducted 3 months after changing the regimen, and dispensing should confirm ARV dosing as per weight.
- Community follow-up should review linkage to adherence support systems and conduct home visits as required.
- Regimen switching may be appropriate for patients on first-line ART regimens other than TDF/3TC/DTG if viral load is not suppressed or if there are adverse drug reactions.

- Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical Technical Working Group (TWG) for guidance on urgent collection of drug resistance testing (DRT) samples.
- In cases where rifampicin resistance is detected in TB patients, a comprehensive review by a DR TB clinical review team is necessary, along with adjustments to the treatment regimen based on DST results.
- Patients at high risk of drug-resistant TB should have samples collected for FL & SL LPA, culture, and 1st and 2nd line DST, while starting DS TB treatment while awaiting DST results.
- Patients at low risk of drug-resistant TB can start DS TB treatment immediately.

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","Here is a detailed summary of the important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) based on the provided source texts:

- **Efavirenz**: 
  - Co-administration with DTG is not recommended as efavirenz decreases DTG levels.
  - If used together, increase DTG dose to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Etravirine**:
  - Co-administration is not recommended unless used with a protease inhibitor/ritonavir (PI/r), which counteracts the interaction.
  - Without PI/r, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Rifampicin**:
  - Rifampicin lowers DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients over 20 kg.
  - For children under 20 kg, increase the weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.
  - No significant interactions with other anti-TB medications.

- **Rifapentine**:
  - Potential decreased DTG levels with once-weekly rifapentine; no dose adjustment unless viral load becomes detectable, then increase DTG to twice daily.

- **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**:
  - These drugs decrease DTG levels; avoid use if possible.
  - If co-administration is necessary, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily and monitor viral load.

- **Mineral Supplements and Antacids**:
  - Supplements containing calcium, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum decrease DTG absorption.
  - Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements.
  - Dose separation is not required if DTG is taken with a meal.

- **Metformin**:
  - DTG increases metformin plasma levels; consider reducing metformin dose.
  - Limit metformin to a maximum daily dose of 1,000 mg.

- **Methadone**:
  - No interaction with DTG.

- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**:
  - DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - Discuss pregnancy intentions with women initiating ART.

These interactions highlight the importance of dose adjustments and timing of administration to manage potential decreases in DTG efficacy or increases in other drug levels.",1.0,0.9645169828191099,25.39,hybrid,gpt-4o
How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11.

(This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

- **Indications for PrEP**:
  - PrEP is recommended for HIV-uninfected individuals at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition.
  - Risk factors include having an HIV-positive partner not on ART or with poor adherence, engaging in transactional sex, having a history of STIs, inconsistent condom use, and sharing needles.

- **Eligibility Criteria**:
  - Confirmed HIV-negative status through testing.
  - Willingness to adhere to the PrEP regimen.
  - No recent illness consistent with acute HIV infection.
  - No contraindications to the ARVs used in PrEP.
  - Assessment of renal and liver function if there is a history of related diseases.

- **Pre-initiation Client Education**:
  - Explain how PrEP works as part of combination HIV prevention.
  - Discuss the need for baseline and follow-up tests, including regular HIV testing.
  - Educate on PrEP use, including medication types, dosing frequency, and handling missed doses.
  - Discuss the limitations of PrEP, such as its inability to prevent pregnancies and STIs.
  - Provide risk reduction counseling, including mental health support, access to condoms, and STI screening.

- **Recommended ARVs for PrEP**:
  - Preferred regimen: Tenofovir 300mg/Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) as a fixed-dose combination tablet taken daily.
  - Alternative regimen: Tenofovir 300mg/Lamivudine 300mg (TDF/3TC) as a fixed-dose combination tablet taken daily.

- **Additional Considerations**:
  - Screen for gender-based violence and provide appropriate interventions.
  - Assess mental health status to address any issues that may affect adherence.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding ART failure from the provided source texts:

- **Definition and Causes of Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure occurs when ART no longer effectively suppresses the HIV virus due to resistance.
  - Resistance can develop if ART is not taken correctly, including missed doses or stopping and starting treatment multiple times.
  - Treatment failure is suspected when a viral load (VL) is ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART.
  - Treatment failure is confirmed if VL remains ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing adherence issues or other causes of high VL.

- **Consequences of Treatment Failure:**
  - The virus can increase to high levels, reducing CD4 count and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections.
  - ART may need to be switched to stronger, more expensive regimens, which may involve more pills and potential side effects.
  - If resistance develops to the new ART regimen, options may become limited, leading to rapid viral increase and significant CD4 count decline.

- **Adherence and Monitoring:**
  - Adherence to ART is crucial to prevent resistance and treatment failure.
  - Patients should follow a care plan, attend appointments, and take medications as prescribed.
  - Adherence support should be tailored to the patient's needs and monitored continuously, even with viral suppression.
  - Systems should be in place to identify and address missed appointments promptly.

- **Management of Treatment Failure:**
  - Before changing ART regimens, identify and address the reasons for treatment failure using a case-management approach.
  - Ensure that adherence issues or other barriers are resolved before confirming treatment failure and switching regimens.

- **General ART Guidelines:**
  - ART aims to suppress viral replication to undetectable levels (VL < 50 copies/ml).
  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of CD4 count or other factors.
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally within two weeks.

These points highlight the importance of adherence, monitoring, and timely intervention in managing ART failure.",1.0,0.9444767704710978,18.49,hybrid,gpt-4o
How do you manage HIV in pregnancy?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression. Table 7.2 summarizes recommendations for use of ART for HIV positive pregnant women.\n\n### Table 7.2: Summary of Use of ART for HIV Positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women\n\n| Overall recommendations             | Overall recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| When to start                       | ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count and continued lifelong.

  - ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 cell count, and continued lifelong.
  - Ideally, ART should start on the same day as HIV diagnosis after a readiness assessment, with ongoing adherence support.
  - The recommended first-line ART regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG.

- **Infant Prophylaxis:**
  - Infants should receive AZT+NVP for 6 weeks.
  - NVP should continue until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - Use same-day point-of-care methods for viral load testing when possible to expedite results and decision-making.
  - For newly initiated ART, obtain viral load (VL) 3 months after initiation, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For women already on ART, obtain VL irrespective of prior testing, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - If VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, assess for reasons for viremia, intensify adherence support, and repeat VL after 3 months.
    - If repeat VL is 200-999 copies/ml, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.

When should infants start ART?,"[""# 6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival.

  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of factors such as CD4 count, age, pregnancy status, or co-infection status.

- **Timing of ART Initiation:**
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 2 weeks of HIV confirmation, and can be started on the same day as testing positive if the patient is ready.
  - Same-day ART initiation is particularly beneficial for certain groups, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, and is associated with improved outcomes.

- **Special Considerations for Infants:**
  - Infants under 12 months should start ART on the same day as a positive HIV PCR test.
  - A confirmatory PCR test should be conducted immediately after the first positive result, but ART initiation should not be delayed for the second PCR result.
  - Intensive adherence counseling and support are crucial due to the limited time for caregiver preparation.

- **Caregiver Role and Preparation:**
  - Caregivers play a critical role in administering ART to infants and children and should be well-prepared for this responsibility.
  - It is important for caregivers to be shown and then demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs at both the prescribing and dispensing stages.
  - Ideally, the caregiver accompanying the child for clinical reviews should be the same person responsible for daily ART administration.

- **First-Line ART Regimens for Infants:**
  - For infants from birth to 4 weeks, the preferred regimen is AZT + 3TC + NVP.
  - Infants who start ART before 4 weeks should switch to ABC/3TC + DTG once they reach 4 weeks of age.
  - Weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit for children and adolescents under 15 years.

- **General ART Management:**
  - All patients, including infants, should have their weight documented at every visit to ensure correct dosing.
  - More than one caregiver should be informed about the child's HIV status and trained in ART administration to ensure continuity of care.",1.0,0.8661592668861579,17.77,hybrid,gpt-4o

HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed prior to PrEP initiation:\n\n### Table 11.3: Client Education Checklist\n\n| Topic

- **Initial Monitoring:**
  - Viral load is measured at the start of ART for PCR-positive HIV-exposed infants (HEIs).
  - For all patients, viral load is measured at 3 months after starting ART.

- **Routine Monitoring:**
  - **Children and Adolescents (Ages 0-24):** Viral load is monitored every 6 months after the initial 3-month test.
  - **Adults (Ages ≥ 25):** After the initial 3-month test, viral load is monitored at 12 months, and then annually if the viral load is suppressed.
  - **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:**
    - If already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy, viral load is measured at confirmation of pregnancy and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
    - If starting ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding, viral load is measured 3 months after initiation and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.

- **Special Circumstances:**
  - Before any drug substitution for patients on ART for at least 6 months with no valid viral load, a test is conducted.
  - Viral load is measured 3 months after any regimen modification.
  - If a patient has a detectable viral load during routine monitoring, follow-up is guided by a specific viral load monitoring algorithm.

- **Understanding Viral Load Results:**
  - An undetectable viral load indicates effective ART, meaning the virus is not damaging the body.
  - A detectable viral load suggests treatment issues, often due to missed doses, requiring intervention to address the problem.

This monitoring schedule ensures that treatment efficacy is assessed regularly, and any issues with ART can be promptly addressed to maintain the health of PLHIV.",1.0,0.9318926371134534,18.67,hybrid,gpt-4o
What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the preferred first-line regimen for adults from the provided source texts:

- **Preferred First-Line ART Regimen for Adults:**
  - For adults (≥ 15 years old), the preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is a combination of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and Dolutegravir (DTG).
  - The dosing for this regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tablet once daily.

- **General ART Guidelines:**
  - All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, regardless of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, or risk group, as long as they are willing and ready to start ART.
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally on the same day or within two weeks.

- **Adherence and Monitoring:**
  - Adherence preparation, monitoring, and support should be tailored to the patient's level of adherence and stage of ART initiation and follow-up.
  - Patients with durable viral suppression should receive messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).
  - Adherence monitoring, counseling, and support should continue even if the patient has achieved viral suppression, as new or worsening barriers to adherence can occur.

- **Transition and Optimization:**
  - Patients currently on first-line regimens not included in the preferred or alternative regimens should be considered for regimen optimization.
  - Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but not on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed and transitioned to the preferred regimen.

- **Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least three months of ART.
  - Treatment failure is confirmed when VL remains ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing adherence issues or other reasons for high VL.",1.0,0.9468872213795319,23.43,hybrid,gpt-4o
Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

  - DTG is considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - It is important to discuss pregnancy intentions with all women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), regardless of the regimen.
  - Women who do not wish to become pregnant should receive appropriate family planning counseling and methods.

- **First-Line ART for Pregnant Women:**
  - The recommended first-line ART regimen for HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women includes Tenofovir (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and Dolutegravir (DTG).
  - ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 cell count, and continued lifelong.
  - Ideally, ART should start on the same day as the HIV diagnosis after a readiness assessment, with ongoing enhanced adherence support.

- **Monitoring During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**
  - Viral load monitoring is crucial during pregnancy and breastfeeding to ensure viral suppression and prevent HIV transmission.
  - For women newly initiated on ART, a viral load test should be done 3 months after initiation and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For women already on ART at the time of pregnancy confirmation, a viral load test should be done irrespective of the timing of the last test, and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - If viral load is ≥ 50 copies/ml, assess and address potential reasons for viremia, intensify adherence support, and repeat the viral load test after 3 months of excellent adherence.

- **Drug Interactions with DTG:**
  - Rifampicin lowers DTG levels; therefore, DTG dosage should be increased to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who weigh more than 20 kg.
  - Mineral supplements (e.g., antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum, iron supplements, prenatal vitamins) decrease DTG absorption. DTG should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements.
  - No dose separation is required for calcium and iron supplements if DTG is taken with a meal.
  - Certain anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) decrease DTG levels; alternative anticonvulsants should be used if available.
  - DTG increases metformin levels; a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of the usual dose) should be used, with a maximum daily dose of 1 g.

- **Regimen Optimization:**
  - Patients with suppressed viral load on first-line ART may benefit from regimen optimization to prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness.

- **Renal Impairment:**
  - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min, especially when used in combination with lamivudine (3TC).
  - Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is associated with renal toxicity, although to a lesser degree than TDF, and should be used cautiously in patients with renal issues.

- **Drug Interactions:**
  - TDF should not be used with didanosine (ddI) due to potential adverse interactions.
  - TDF should not be used in triple nucleoside combinations with 3TC and ddI or abacavir (ABC).
  - When TDF is used with atazanavir (ATV), it significantly reduces ATV levels, so it should be combined with ritonavir (RTV) to boost ATV levels.
  - TAF levels are increased by RTV and cobicistat, and decreased by darunavir (DRV). Boosted protease inhibitors (PI) increase TAF levels, but PI levels are not affected.
  - Avoid co-administration of TAF with rifabutin, rifampicin, and phenytoin.

- **Hepatitis B Considerations:**
  - Patients should ideally be screened for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before starting TDF or TAF therapy, as exacerbation of hepatitis B has been reported upon discontinuation of these drugs.

- **Toxicity Concerns:**
  - TDF is associated with nephrotoxicity and pancreatitis, and both TDF and TAF can cause lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, which can be fatal.

These points highlight the scenarios and conditions under which tenofovir, particularly TDF and TAF, should be used with caution or avoided.",1.0,0.9746279709292923,20.4,hybrid,gpt-4o

TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the management of HIV in tuberculosis (TB) coinfection based on the provided source texts:

- **General Management:**
  - All people living with HIV (PLHIV) diagnosed with TB should be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) as part of their comprehensive care.
  - Close monitoring for toxicity and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is essential.

- **Timing of ART Initiation:**
  - **For Patients Not Yet on ART:**
    - Start TB treatment immediately.
    - Initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks.
    - For TB meningitis, delay ART initiation for 4 to 8 weeks.
  - **For Patients Already on ART:**
    - Continue ART while starting TB treatment immediately.
    - Assess for treatment failure and adjust ART regimen as needed due to drug-drug interactions.

- **Preferred ART Regimens:**
  - **Newly Initiating 1st Line ART:**
    - **Birth to 4 weeks:** Start anti-TB treatment immediately; initiate ART after 4 weeks of age.
    - **>4 weeks to <15 years (<30 kg):** Use ABC + 3TC + DTG, with increased DTG dosing frequency during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.
    - **≥30 kg and ≥15 years:** Use TDF/3TC/DTG FDC with additional DTG dosing during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.
  - **Patients Developing TB While Virally Suppressed on 1st Line ART:**
    - **PI/r-based Regimen:** Switch to DTG or adjust PI/r dosing with ritonavir super-boosting.
    - **RAL-based Regimen:** Switch to double-dose DTG during TB treatment.
    - **DTG-based Regimen:** Administer double-dose DTG during rifampicin-containing TB treatment.

- **TB Screening and Prevention:**
  - TB screening should be conducted at every clinical visit using the Intensified Case Finding (ICF) tool.
  - Patients screening positive for TB symptoms should undergo definitive diagnostic testing.
  - Patients screening negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).
  - Healthcare settings should implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce transmission risk.

- **Counseling and Education:**
  - PLHIV should receive counseling on TB risk, exposure reduction strategies, recognizing TB symptoms, and seeking care promptly.
  - Education on TB transmission risks and preventive therapy is crucial.

- **Special Considerations:**
  - Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) and HIV coinfection require management in settings with experienced clinicians and close monitoring capabilities.",1.0,0.9551396221032701,25.73,hybrid,gpt-4o

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '### Table 3.6 Cont.\n\n| Test                                   | Recommended | Frequency/Indication                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| CrAg                                   | ✔           | Baseline for adults and adolescents with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³ (as reflex testing by laboratory), then only if there is clinical suspicion of CM                                                                   |\n| Hb                                     | ✔           | Baseline, then symptom directed; if on AZT, baseline then weeks 2, 4, and 12                                                                                                                                     |\n| Pregnancy Status                       | ✔           | At every visit for women of reproductive age (by history +/- urine pregnancy test)                                                                                                                               |\n| Urinalysis (protein & glucose)         | ✔           | Baseline, then annually if on TDF                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Creatinine                             | ✔           | Baseline, then annually if on TDF                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Glucose                                | ✔           | Baseline, then annually                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Plasma lipid profile                   | ✔           | Baseline, then annually                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| HBsAg                                  | ✔           | Baseline, followed by immunization for all patients who screen negative (after viral suppression is confirmed)                                                                                                   |\n| Syphilis serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR) | ✔           | Baseline, then annually in those at risk and as part of routine ANC profile                                                                                                                                      |\n| Drug Resistance Testing                |             | DRT recommended once treatment failure confirmed on a DTG- or PI-based 1st line regimen, or confirmed treatment failure on 2nd line or subsequent regimens                                                       |\n| ALT                                    |             | Not recommended for routine baseline or follow-up unless specific clinical indication                                                                                                                            |\n| Cervical Cancer                        |             | All women should be screened for cervical cancer following the national guidelines.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review. Aligning']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding lab tests used to monitor ART from the provided source texts:

- **Baseline and Routine Monitoring Tests:**
  - **CD4 Testing:** Essential for diagnosing Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) and determining eligibility for care packages. Conducted as a baseline test for all PLHIV, especially for new clients initiating ART and those reinitiating after treatment interruption.
  - **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Baseline testing for all patients, especially those on AZT. Follow-up at weeks 2, 4, and 12 if on AZT.
  - **Creatinine:** Baseline and annual testing for all patients, particularly those starting on TDF, to calculate Creatinine Clearance (CrCl).
  - **Urinalysis (Protein & Glucose):** Baseline and annual testing for all patients, especially if on TDF.
  - **Glucose and Plasma Lipid Profile:** Baseline and annual testing for all patients.
  - **HBsAg:** Baseline testing for all adolescent and adult patients, followed by immunization for those who screen negative after viral suppression.
  - **Syphilis Serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR):** Baseline and annual testing for sexually active patients and as part of routine ANC profile.
  - **HCV Antibody:** Baseline testing for patients with a history of injection drug use.

- **Specialized Tests:**
  - **CrAg (Cryptococcal Antigen):** Baseline testing for adults and adolescents with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³, and if there is clinical suspicion of cryptococcal meningitis.
  - **Pregnancy Test:** Conducted at every visit for women of reproductive age.
  - **HPV Testing:** For women aged 25-49, conducted at baseline and every two years, following cancer screening guidelines.

- **Tests with Specific Indications:**
  - **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):** Not recommended for routine baseline or follow-up unless there is a specific clinical indication, such as a history of hepatitis or risk of liver disease.
  - **Drug Resistance Testing:** Recommended once treatment failure is confirmed on a DTG- or PI-based first-line regimen, or on second-line or subsequent regimens.

- **General Recommendations:**
  - Laboratory tests are highly recommended for monitoring but are not prerequisites for ART initiation.
  - Facilities should arrange for specimen transport to reference laboratories if on-site testing is unavailable.
  - ART should be initiated as soon as possible for all PLHIV, with follow-up to address any issues delaying initiation.
  - Differentiated care models should be adapted for children, adolescents, and pregnant/breastfeeding women to address unique challenges in retention and viral suppression.",1.0,0.9548969396802499,26.75,hybrid,gpt-4o
When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the initiation of second-line ART based on the provided source texts:

- **General Guidelines for Second-line ART Initiation:**
  - Second-line ART is initiated when a patient fails a first-line regimen, confirmed by a Drug Resistance Test (DRT).
  - Non-adherence is the most common cause of treatment failure; adherence issues must be addressed before confirming treatment failure.
  - Daily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to ensure excellent adherence before repeating the viral load (VL) test.
  - If a drug in the recommended second-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG for guidance.

- **Specific Considerations for Different Patient Groups:**
  - **Infants and Children:**
    - Second-line ART management is complex and requires thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment.
    - All children failing first-line ART should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) and with an experienced ART provider.
    - Limited options for infants and children may necessitate consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.
  - **Adults and Adolescents:**
    - For those ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old, a DRT-based second-line regimen is recommended.
    - Pregnant and breastfeeding women should have a sample taken for DRT and may be switched to a temporary regimen while awaiting results.

- **Second-line ART Regimen Recommendations:**
  - Regimens are adjusted based on the patient's weight, age, and specific circumstances (e.g., pregnancy, co-infections).
  - For patients < 30 kg, regimens are adjusted based on DRT results.
  - For patients ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old, a DRT-based second-line regimen is recommended.
  - Pregnant and breastfeeding women may require temporary regimen changes while awaiting DRT results.

- **Second-line ART Treatment Failure:**
  - Confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm.
  - Patients failing second-line ART have limited options and may require more expensive and complex third-line regimens.
  - Thorough assessment for adherence barriers and enhanced adherence support is crucial.
  - Consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG is necessary for designing a suitable third-line regimen.

- **Adherence Support:**
  - Assign a case manager and provide more frequent adherence counseling.
  - Assess and treat mental health and substance use disorders to support adherence.

These points provide a comprehensive overview of when and how second-line ART is initiated, emphasizing the importance of addressing adherence issues and consulting with specialized teams for regimen adjustments.",1.0,0.9457925828370546,18.0,hybrid,gpt-4o

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","Here is a detailed summary of the recommended adherence strategies for HIV/AIDS treatment based on the provided source texts:

- **Adherence Monitoring Strategies:**
  - **Subjective (Self-reported Adherence):**
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 at every patient visit to assess adherence.
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 when adherence problems are suspected.
  - **Objective Monitoring:**
    - Conduct pill counts at every visit until viral suppression is confirmed and whenever adherence issues are suspected.
    - Review pharmacy refill records at every drug pick-up and when adherence issues are suspected.
    - Monitor viral load following specific algorithms, with different frequencies based on age and pregnancy status.

- **Home Visits and Observations:**
  - Assess where and how patients store and take medications.
  - Conduct home visits, if consented, to understand living situations and barriers to adherence.

- **Provider-Patient Relationship:**
  - Develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients.
  - Regularly inquire about adherence in an open and inquisitive manner.

- **Training and Support:**
  - Train all providers in adherence assessment and support.
  - Refer patients with significant adherence challenges to specialized providers.
  - Involve experienced colleagues and multidisciplinary teams for complex cases.

- **Adherence Preparation and Support:**
  - Begin adherence strategies at the point of HIV diagnosis and continue throughout treatment.
  - Tailor adherence support to the patient's level of adherence and stage of ART initiation.
  - Ensure follow-up by the same care provider or team whenever possible.

- **ART Initiation and Follow-up:**
  - Provide HIV education and adherence preparation at enrolment.
  - Assess ART readiness and create individualized adherence support plans.
  - Schedule follow-up appointments to review adherence and side effects, especially in the first few months.
  - Monitor adherence at every visit and provide counseling based on adherence levels.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - Conduct viral load tests at specified intervals to confirm adherence.
  - Address poor adherence and barriers if viral load is ≥ 200 copies/ml, following enhanced adherence assessment and interventions.

These strategies emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, personalized support, and a strong provider-patient relationship to ensure high levels of adherence to ART.",1.0,0.93757242107593,26.78,hybrid,gpt-4o

- **Dietary Considerations:**
  - Preferably taken on an empty stomach.
  - Can be taken with food, but high-fat meals should be avoided as they increase absorption.

- **Major Side Effects:**
  - Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms: somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia, etc.
  - Skin rash.
  - Avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy.
  - Avoid in patients with a history of psychiatric disease due to CNS side effects.

- **Drug-Drug Interactions:**
  - **Antiretrovirals:**
    - Co-administration with dolutegravir (DTG) is not recommended as EFV decreases DTG levels. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
    - Co-administration with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) is not recommended as EFV decreases ATV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.
    - Avoid co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) due to increased risk of prolonged-QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death.
    - Co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) is not recommended as DRV/r may increase EFV levels, leading to toxicity, and EFV decreases DRV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.

  - **Antifungals:**
    - Voriconazole: EFV increases voriconazole levels by 44% and decreases voriconazole levels by 77%. This combination is not recommended.

  - **Anti-Mycobacterials:**
    - Rifampicin: EFV levels decrease by 25%. Consider increasing EFV dose to 800 mg daily.

  - **Oral Contraceptives:**
    - EFV decreases ethinyl estradiol levels by 37%. Use alternative or additional contraceptive methods.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Can be used with rifampicin in TB patients, but dose adjustments may be necessary.
  - Monitor for potential additive hepatotoxicity when used with other hepatotoxic drugs.",1.0,0.9515653521800426,33.18,hybrid,gpt-4o
Can HIV be managed with a two-drug regimen?,"['# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', 'The general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co-infected patients initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n## B. Recommended first-line ART in HIV/HBV co-infection\n\n> The recommended first-line ART in adolescents and adults with HIV/HBV co-infection is TDF + 3TC + DTG, including for women and adolescent girls of childbearing potential\n\nTreatment with both TDF (or TAF) and 3TC is recommended as 3TC without TDF or TAF will result in rapid emergence of resistance. In case of renal impairment (as assessed by creatinine clearance), the dose of TDF and 3TC should be adjusted (Table 9.3).\n\n### Table 9.2: Summary of Initial Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation in HIV/HBV Co-infection\n\n| Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **History**<br/>Alcohol use, cigarette smoking, intravenous drug use, risky sexual practices, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, early satiety, haematemesis, dark stool, bleeding, pruritus | Assess, counsel and support to stop taking alcohol; counsel and support smoking cessation; counsel and provide or refer for harm reduction interventions<br/><br/>discuss or refer to a consultant for additional evaluation and management |\n| **Physical examination**<br/>Enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, ascites, scratch marks                                                                                                                     | Evidence of established chronic liver disease, closer follow-up due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity.<br/><br/>discuss or refer to a consultant for additional evaluation and management                                                 |\n| **ALT**<br/>If elevated, may point to active liver disease.

  - DTG is a preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children, adolescents, and adults due to its high efficacy, tolerance, and resistance barrier.
  - It is typically administered as a 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily for individuals weighing ≥ 20 kg.
  - DTG can be taken with or without food and is available in fixed-dose combinations (FDC).

- **DTG Dosing Adjustments:**
  - For patients on rifampicin, DTG should be taken twice daily during TB treatment and for two weeks after.
  - Patients with suspected or confirmed integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance should also take DTG twice daily.

- **DTG Side Effects:**
  - Common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea, which usually resolve within 1-2 weeks.
  - Insomnia may occur and can be mitigated by taking DTG in the morning or with a low-fat meal.
  - DTG may cause a slight increase in serum creatinine levels, not indicative of renal function decline.
  - Integrase inhibitors like DTG are associated with weight gain; patients should be counseled on healthy lifestyle choices.

- **Two-Drug Regimen Consideration:**
  - DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available.

- **HIV/HBV Co-infection Management:**
  - The recommended first-line ART for HIV/HBV co-infected patients is TDF + 3TC + DTG.
  - TDF (or TAF) and 3TC should be used together to prevent rapid resistance development.
  - In cases of renal impairment, TDF and 3TC doses should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance levels.

- **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
  - Closer monitoring of liver function is advised for HBV-positive patients due to higher hepatotoxicity risk.
  - Initial evaluations should include assessments of alcohol use, liver enlargement, ALT levels, and creatinine clearance.
  - Adjustments in ART dosing may be necessary based on renal function, especially in HIV/HBV co-infected patients.",1.0,0.8374359258072349,23.2,hybrid,gpt-4o
How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.']","To handle treatment failure in HIV/AIDS management, consider the following key points from the provided source texts:

- **Understanding Treatment Failure:**
  - Treatment failure occurs when ART (antiretroviral therapy) no longer works because the virus has become resistant.
  - Resistance can develop from not taking ART correctly, starting and stopping medications, or missing doses.
  - When resistance occurs, stronger and more expensive ART may be required, which might not be as effective and could have more side effects.

- **Consequences of Treatment Failure:**
  - The virus can increase rapidly, reducing CD4 count and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections.
  - If resistance develops to the new ART, there may be no effective drugs left, leading to rapid viral increase and significant health deterioration.

- **Importance of Adherence:**
  - Adherence involves taking ART as prescribed, attending clinic appointments, and following care plans.
  - Correct dosage and timing are crucial to prevent resistance and treatment failure.
  - Enhanced adherence counseling is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure.

- **Enhanced Adherence Counseling:**
  - Assess the patient's understanding of viral load and reasons for high viral load.
  - Discuss potential barriers to adherence, including cognitive and behavioral factors.
  - Explore the patient's routine, dosing schedule, and use of reminder tools.
  - Address any side effects and how they are managed.
  - Encourage planning for travel and managing medication supply.

- **Addressing Barriers:**
  - Identify cognitive barriers by assessing the patient's knowledge about HIV, ART, and the importance of adherence.
  - Review behavioral barriers by discussing the patient's drug-taking routine and any challenges faced.
  - Encourage the use of reminder tools and planning for travel to maintain adherence.
  - Discuss the management of side effects and any influence they have on adherence.

- **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
  - Conduct regular viral load tests to monitor the effectiveness of ART.
  - Provide ongoing support and counseling to address adherence issues and adjust treatment plans as necessary.",0.9545454545454546,0.8982926015321683,21.98,hybrid,gpt-4o

- **Treatment Failure Confirmation**: Before switching to a new regimen, confirm treatment failure through repeated high viral load measurements.

- **Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Involvement**: Decisions to switch regimens should involve discussions with an MDT and consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical Technical Working Group (TWG).

- **Patient Preparation and Education**:
  - Conduct targeted counseling and education to prepare the patient for the new regimen.
  - Assess and enhance the patient’s understanding of HIV, viral load, ART, and the importance of adherence.
  - Educate the patient on the complexity of 2nd/3rd line ART, including more pills, twice-a-day dosing, and limited future options if this fails.
  - Provide simple take-home information, education, and communication (IEC) materials on ART management.

- **Adherence Support**:
  - Address all barriers to adherence through Enhanced Adherence Counselling before switching regimens.
  - Construct a detailed adherence plan and confirm the patient’s willingness to start the new regimen.
  - Plan sessions with pharmacists and nutritionists to support medication adherence and address nutritional aspects.
  - Reinforce adherence during every clinic visit and through enhanced adherence counseling sessions.

- **Follow-Up and Monitoring**:
  - Ensure monthly follow-up counseling sessions during clinic visits for the first 6 months after initiating the new regimen.
  - Conduct viral load testing 3 months after the regimen change. If undetectable, continue adherence counseling every 3 months; if detectable, discuss with MDT and consult Clinical TWG.
  - First follow-up should be within 2 weeks of initiation of 3rd line ART, with subsequent visits monthly until confirmed viral suppression at 6 months.

- **Clinical and Community Support**:
  - Conduct thorough clinical assessments, manage co-infections and co-morbidities, and evaluate for potential drug interactions and side effects.
  - Link patients to community adherence support systems and plan for home visits as required.
  - Assign a case manager to the patient and ensure linkage to support groups and community health volunteers/assistants.

- **Documentation and Reporting**:
  - Complete necessary clinical encounter forms and maintain accurate records of adherence, viral load, and treatment outcomes.
  - Send an annual report with viral load, adherence, and outcomes to the National AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCOP).

These steps ensure that regimen switching is conducted effectively, with a focus on patient education, adherence support, and continuous monitoring to achieve optimal treatment outcomes.",1.0,0.866844694795898,30.42,hybrid,gpt-4o
What is the role of resistance testing?,"['# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","- **Resistance Testing Role:**
  - Resistance testing is crucial in managing HIV treatment, particularly in cases of suspected treatment failure.
  - It helps identify the presence of drug-resistant HIV strains, which can guide the selection of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens.
  - Resistance testing is recommended before changing ART regimens in patients with confirmed treatment failure (viral load ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after addressing adherence issues).
  - It aids in optimizing ART regimens to ensure viral suppression and prevent further resistance development.
  - Resistance testing is part of a comprehensive approach to managing HIV, including adherence support and monitoring, to ensure the effectiveness of ART.",0.16666666666666666,0.9230822210755129,16.14,hybrid,gpt-4o

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","- Efavirenz:

This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed prior to PrEP initiation:\n\n### Table 11.3: Client Education Checklist\n\n| Topic

Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive for syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and ensure they are treated for syphilis.\n\nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after birth.\n\n# 7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'. Ask the patient to explain what each of these terms mean. Provide education if patient requires more explanation\n* Provide VL result and explanation of result:<br/>""You have a detectable viral load. There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.']","- ART failure occurs when the virus becomes resistant to the medication, leading to the need for stronger, more expensive ART that may not work as well.
- If treatment fails, the patient may need to take more pills every day and may experience more side effects.
- It is crucial to take ART every day as prescribed to avoid treatment failure and maintain a healthy life.
- Side effects of ART can include headache, loss of appetite, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pains.
- If a patient experiences side effects, they should continue taking their ART as prescribed and discuss the side effects with their clinician.
- Adherence to ART is essential, including attending clinic appointments, picking up medicines, taking them as prescribed, getting lab tests, and following nutritional recommendations.
- Patients should take the correct dosage of ART, at the correct time of day, and according to dietary restrictions.
- Enhanced adherence counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure involves assessing the patient's understanding of viral load, discussing possible reasons for a high viral load, and working on improving adherence through counseling sessions.
- Assessing possible barriers to adherence includes cognitive barriers (knowledge about HIV and ART) and behavioral barriers (how the patient takes drugs, reminder tools, handling side effects, difficult situations for taking drugs, and substance use).",1.0,0.9026647570619436,9.98,hybrid,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
How do you manage HIV in pregnancy?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV/Syphilis/Hepatitis B\n\nRoutine antenatal care (ANC) offers an important opportunity to provide high quality combined HIV prevention through targeted health education and counselling; HIV testing for the woman, partners and family members; linkage to HIV prevention and treatment; and to discuss and plan for future conception and contraception needs. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit.

When should infants start ART?,"[""# 6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART initiation are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n## Table 6.1: Special Considerations for Timing of ART Initiation\n\n| Population                                                   | Timing of ART Initiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Additional Notes                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pregnant and breastfeeding women                             | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Intensive adherence counselling, support and close follow-up required because of limited time for patient preparation   |\n| Infants (< 12 months old)                                    | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV.

(This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","- Preferred first-line ART regimen for adults includes TDF + 3TC + DTG

Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

- Women initiating ART should discuss pregnancy intention regardless of regimen.
- Pregnant women should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods if they do not wish to become pregnant.
- DTG levels are lowered by rifampicin, so the dose should be increased for patients on rifampicin.
- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other anti-TB medications.
- Mineral supplements can decrease the absorption of DTG, so it should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking these supplements.
- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin can decrease DTG levels, so a different anticonvulsant should be used if available.
- Metformin levels are increased by DTG, so a lower dose of metformin should be used and glycemic control should be monitored.
- Patients should be educated about these important drug interactions.
- Monitoring during ART is important to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment.
- Regimen optimization may be necessary for patients with undetectable viral load, adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities, or treatment failure.
- Dolutegravir is preferred as part of first-line ART for children, adolescents, and adults.
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV should initiate ART regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 cell count.
- TDF/3TC/DTG is recommended as first-line ART for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
- Viral load monitoring should be done during pregnancy and breastfeeding, with specific guidelines for when to obtain viral load tests and how to manage different viral load levels.",1.0,0.9118812976615313,11.18,hybrid,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","- Second-line ART should be initiated if any drug in the recommended first-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","- Adherence monitoring strategies include subjective (self-reported adherence) and objective methods

- The recommended dose for adults is 600mg once daily, preferably taken at bedtime.
- EFV should preferably be taken on an empty stomach, but it can be taken with food. High-fat meals should be avoided as they increase absorption.
- Major side effects of EFV include CNS symptoms (somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia), skin rash, and it should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.
- EFV can be used with rifampicin in TB patients.
- Contraindications to EFV include a history of psychiatric disease and the first trimester of pregnancy.
- Efavirenz (EFV) decreases the plasma levels of dolutegravir (DTG), so co-administration is not recommended. If used together, DTG should be increased to 50 mg twice daily.
- EFV decreases the serum concentration of atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), which may lead to resistance and treatment failure, so co-administration is not recommended.
- EFV decreases the levels of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), and this combination should be avoided due to an increased risk of prolonged-QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death.

How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.']","- Treatment failure occurs when the virus becomes resistant to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to incorrect or irregular usage
- If treatment fails, stronger and more expensive ART may be needed, but it may not work as well
- Resistance to the new ART can lead to a situation where no drugs are effective, causing the virus to increase quickly and CD4 count to decrease
- It is crucial to take ART every day as prescribed to avoid treatment failure and maintain a healthy life
- Side effects of ART can include headache, loss of appetite, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pains
- If experiencing side effects, continue taking ART as prescribed and discuss with the clinician at the next appointment
- Severe side effects like rash all over the body, constant vomiting, or inability to eat should prompt immediate discussion with the clinician
- Adherence to ART is essential for successful treatment, including attending clinic appointments, taking medications as prescribed, and following dietary restrictions
- Enhanced adherence counseling for patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure involves assessing the patient's understanding of viral load, discussing possible reasons for high viral load, and identifying barriers to adherence
- Cognitive barriers to adherence include assessing the patient's knowledge about HIV, ART, and the importance of adherence
- Behavioral barriers to adherence include reviewing how the patient takes drugs, establishing appropriate dosing times, using reminder tools, planning for travel, managing side effects, and addressing substance use issues.",1.0,0.8706442891666676,12.28,hybrid,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","Here is a detailed summary of the important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) based on the provided source texts:

- **Efavirenz**:
  - Co-administration with DTG is not recommended as efavirenz decreases DTG levels.
  - If used together, increase DTG dose to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Etravirine**:
  - Co-administration is not recommended unless used with a protease inhibitor/ritonavir (PI/r), which counteracts the interaction.
  - Without PI/r, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.

- **Rifampicin**:
  - Rifampicin lowers DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients over 20 kg.
  - For children under 20 kg, increase the weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.
  - No significant interactions with other anti-TB medications.

- **Rifapentine**:
  - Potential decreased DTG levels with once-weekly rifapentine; no dose adjustment unless viral load becomes detectable, then increase DTG to twice daily.

- **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**:
  - These drugs decrease DTG levels; avoid use if possible.
  - If co-administration is necessary, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily and monitor viral load.

- **Mineral Supplements and Antacids**:
  - Supplements containing calcium, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum decrease DTG absorption.
  - Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements.
  - Dose separation is not required if DTG is taken with a meal.

- **Metformin**:
  - DTG increases metformin plasma levels; consider reducing metformin dose.
  - Limit metformin to a maximum daily dose of 1,000 mg.

- **Methadone**:
  - No interaction with DTG.

- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**:
  - DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - Discuss pregnancy intentions with women initiating ART and offer family planning counseling if needed.

These interactions highlight the importance of dose adjustments and timing of administration to manage potential decreases in DTG efficacy or increases in other drug levels.",1.0,0.9645169828191099,15.97,cosine,gpt-4o
How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.']","To provide PrEP to adolescent girls, the following key points from the guidelines should be considered:

- **Eligibility and Indications for PrEP:**
  - PrEP is indicated for HIV-uninfected individuals at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition, including those with partners who are HIV positive and not on ART, or on ART with viral non-suppression.
  - Adolescents should be screened for HIV risk using a Risk Assessment Tool, which includes questions about sexual behavior, drug use, and exposure to violence.
  - Eligibility criteria include confirmed HIV-negative status, willingness to adhere to PrEP, absence of acute HIV infection symptoms, and no contraindications to ARVs used in PrEP.

- **Contraindications:**
  - PrEP is contraindicated in adolescents under 15 years or weighing less than 35 kg, those with impaired renal function, and those unable or unwilling to adhere to the PrEP regimen.

- **Initial and Follow-up Assessments:**
  - Regular assessments should include adherence checks, risk reassessment, HIV testing at month 1 and every 3 months thereafter, and monitoring for adverse effects.

- **Discontinuation and Restarting PrEP:**
  - PrEP should be discontinued if the individual tests positive for HIV, experiences renal dysfunction, or requests to stop.
  - If PrEP is discontinued and later restarted, a new HIV test is required, and adherence to the initial assessment protocol is necessary.

- **Adherence Support:**
  - Strategies to improve adherence include using reminder devices, SMS reminders, peer support, and addressing barriers to adherence.

- **Monitoring and Managing Sero-conversion:**
  - Consistent HIV testing is crucial to monitor for sero-conversion, which requires immediate discontinuation of PrEP and initiation of ART.
  - Address barriers to adherence and document sero-conversion in the client’s records.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Screen for gender-based violence and mental health issues, as these can impact adherence and overall health.

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '- Follow up smears should be done for all bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases at end of month 2, 5 and 6 of TB treatment using smear microscopy\n\n- Follow up of RR TB and DR TB should be done as per PMDT guidelines\n\n- Patients taking isoniazid containing regimen should also be given Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) daily for the duration of treatment to reduce the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (see Annex 10 for pyridoxine dosing)\n\nOnce TB treatment is started it should be completed; unless another definitive diagnosis (like lung cancer) is established and TB is ruled out.\n\n\n\nTB-LAM is a rapid point-of-care urine dip-stick test that can be performed at the bedside.

- **TB and HIV Co-infection Management:**
  - TB is a significant cause of illness and death among people living with HIV (PLHIV).
  - Early identification and preventive treatment of TB, along with optimal treatment for both HIV and TB, are crucial.
  - All PLHIV should be counseled on TB risks, exposure reduction, symptom recognition, and the importance of seeking care.

- **TB Screening and Preventive Therapy:**
  - TB screening should be conducted at every clinical visit using the Intensified Case Finding (ICF) tool.
  - Patients who screen negative for active TB should be evaluated for TB Preventive Therapy (TPT).

- **Indications for TB Preventive Therapy (TPT):**
  - TPT is recommended for PLHIV who screen negative for active TB and meet eligibility criteria.
  - Eligible groups include:
    - All PLHIV above 12 months of age, including pregnant and breastfeeding women.
    - Household contacts of individuals with confirmed pulmonary TB.
    - Prisoners and prison staff.
    - Healthcare workers and staff in healthcare settings.
    - Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines.

- **TB-LAM Testing:**
  - TB-LAM is a rapid test for TB diagnosis in PLHIV with advanced disease or severe illness.
  - It is used as an adjunct to GeneXpert, not as a replacement.

- **Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis:**
  - While the source texts do not explicitly mention cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, it is generally indicated for PLHIV to prevent opportunistic infections, particularly when CD4 counts are low or in the presence of other risk factors for opportunistic infections.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding ART failure from the provided source texts:

- **Adherence and Monitoring:**
  - Adherence preparation, monitoring, and support should be tailored to the patient's adherence level and ART stage.
  - Adherence monitoring, counseling, and support should continue even with viral suppression, as all patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence.
  - A functional system must be in place to identify and act on missed appointments within 24 hours.

- **Treatment Failure Identification:**
  - Treatment failure is suspected when a viral load (VL) is ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART.
  - Treatment failure is confirmed when VL remains ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL.

- **Consequences of ART Non-Adherence:**
  - Stopping ART leads to a rapid increase in viral load, returning to pre-treatment levels.
  - Irregular ART intake results in increased viral load, reduced CD4 count, and risk of opportunistic infections.
  - Increased viral load can lead to ART resistance, rendering the treatment ineffective.

- **Management of Treatment Failure:**
  - Do not change ART regimens until the reasons for treatment failure are identified and addressed urgently.
  - If treatment fails due to resistance, stronger and more expensive ART may be required, which may involve more pills and side effects.
  - Continuous adherence to ART is crucial to prevent treatment failure and maintain health.

- **Adherence Importance:**
  - Adherence involves following the care plan, attending appointments, taking medications as prescribed, and following dietary restrictions.
  - Correct dosage and timing are essential to prevent resistance and treatment failure.
  - Missed doses should be taken as soon as remembered, without doubling up on the next dose.

These points emphasize the importance of adherence, monitoring, and timely intervention in managing ART failure.",0.9444444444444444,0.9131403339168603,26.37,cosine,gpt-4o

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, immune reconstitution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) administered prior to conception.\n* Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case manager and/or mentor mother\n* Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care\n* Pregnancy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.\n* Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregnant women should receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary feeding (Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an |', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

- **Routine Antenatal Care (ANC):**
  - Integrate prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B into routine ANC.
  - Provide targeted health education and counseling on HIV prevention and treatment.
  - Encourage at least 8 ANC visits, including health checks, medical tests (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B), and monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being.
  - Discuss future conception and contraception needs.

- **Counseling and Education:**
  - Assess pregnancy intentions for HIV-positive women and plan pregnancies to ensure viral load suppression and immune reconstitution.
  - Provide intensive adherence counseling and HIV education for newly diagnosed women or those initiating ART.
  - Develop an individual birth plan, including place of delivery, emergency transport, and readiness for infant care.
  - Educate on pregnancy danger signs and the importance of returning to ANC if symptoms develop.
  - Promote maternal, infant, and young child nutrition (MIYCN), including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, followed by complementary feeding.

- **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):**
  - Initiate ART in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 count, and continue lifelong.
  - Start ART ideally on the same day as HIV diagnosis after readiness assessment, with ongoing adherence support.
  - Recommended first-line ART regimen: TDF/3TC/DTG.

- **Infant Prophylaxis:**
  - Administer AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, with NVP continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - Use same-day point-of-care methods for viral load testing to expedite results and clinical decision-making.
  - For newly initiated ART, obtain viral load 3 months after initiation, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For women already on ART, obtain viral load irrespective of prior testing, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - Address viremia if viral load is ≥ 50 copies/ml, with intensified adherence support and repeat testing after 3 months.
  - Consult clinical experts if repeat viral load is 200 - 999 copies/ml, and change regimen if ≥ 1,000 copies/ml. Continue routine if < 200 copies/ml.",1.0,0.9408886210659942,21.13,cosine,gpt-4o
When should infants start ART?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

  - All HIV-exposed infants (HEI) should receive antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis.
  - The recommended regimen is 6 weeks of AZT (Zidovudine) + NVP (Nevirapine).
  - NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

- **Testing for HIV-Exposed Infants:**
  - HEI should be tested with DNA PCR within 6 weeks of age or at first contact thereafter.
  - If the initial test is negative, a follow-up DNA PCR should be conducted at 6 months.
  - A third DNA PCR test should be performed at 12 months if the previous tests were negative.

- **Breastfeeding Recommendations:**
  - All infants, regardless of HIV status, should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months.
  - Appropriate complementary foods should be introduced after 6 months.
  - Continued breastfeeding is recommended up to 24 months or beyond.

- **Monitoring and Support for Mothers:**
  - Pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV should initiate ART regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage, or CD4 count.
  - ART should ideally start on the same day as HIV diagnosis after a readiness assessment.
  - Enhanced adherence support, including community-based case management, is crucial.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - For women newly initiated on ART, viral load (VL) should be checked 3 months after initiation and then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - For women already on ART, VL should be checked at pregnancy or breastfeeding confirmation and then every 6 months.
  - If VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, assess and address potential reasons for viremia, intensify adherence support, and repeat VL after 3 months.
  - If repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.
  - If repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen.",1.0,0.8395153171867508,44.6,cosine,gpt-4o
What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review. Aligning']","- **Initial Monitoring:**
  - At the initial visit, a baseline viral load test is recommended for PCR positive HEIs (HIV-exposed infants).
  - For individuals aged 0-24 years, viral load should be checked at month 3 after ART initiation, then every 6 months.
  - For individuals aged 25 years and older, viral load should be checked at month 3, then at month 12, and annually thereafter if the viral load is suppressed.

- **Routine Monitoring:**
  - Viral load should be monitored before any drug substitution for patients on ART for at least 6 months with no valid viral load.
  - After any regimen modification, viral load should be checked at month 3, and then as per the population group guidelines.

- **Special Populations:**
  - Pregnant or breastfeeding women on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy should have a viral load test at confirmation of pregnancy, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.
  - If starting ART during pregnancy or breastfeeding, a viral load test should be done at 3 months after initiation, then every 6 months until breastfeeding cessation.

- **Detectable Viral Load:**
  - Any patient with a detectable viral load during routine monitoring should follow the viral load monitoring algorithm for further management.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Adherence assessment and support should be provided at each visit.
  - Clinical and laboratory follow-up should be performed whenever clinically indicated, beyond the routine schedule.
  - Differentiated care models may be beneficial for children, adolescents, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and key populations to address unique challenges in retention and viral suppression.",0.9411764705882353,0.897988621506762,11.61,cosine,gpt-4o
What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10).

- **Preferred First-Line Regimen for Adults:**
  - The recommended first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for adults is a combination of:
    - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)
    - Lamivudine (3TC)
    - Dolutegravir (DTG)
  - The dosing for this regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tablet once daily.

- **General Recommendations:**
  - All patients should have their weight documented at every visit to ensure correct dosing.
  - For patients currently on first-line regimens not included in the preferred or alternative regimens, regimen optimization should be considered.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available.
  - DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available.

This summary provides the key points regarding the preferred first-line ART regimen for adults, including the specific medications and dosing instructions.",1.0,0.9615677856870263,12.11,cosine,gpt-4o
Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available']","- **Safety During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**
  - Dolutegravir (DTG) is considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
  - It is important to discuss pregnancy intentions with all women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), regardless of the regimen.
  - Women who do not wish to become pregnant should receive appropriate family planning counseling and methods.

- **Drug Interactions:**
  - **Rifampicin:** Lowers DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who weigh more than 20 kg. For children under 20 kg, adjust the DTG dose to twice daily.
  - **Mineral Supplements:** Antacids and supplements containing calcium, zinc, magnesium, aluminum, and iron decrease DTG absorption. Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements. Dose separation is not required if DTG is taken with a meal.
  - **Anticonvulsants:** Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin decrease DTG levels. Use alternative anticonvulsants if possible. If co-administration is necessary, increase DTG to twice daily.
  - **Metformin:** DTG increases metformin levels; reduce metformin dose (often to 50% of the usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Maximum daily dose of metformin should be 1 g.

- **Dosing and Administration:**
  - DTG is preferred in first-line ART for children, adolescents, and adults due to its high efficacy and tolerability.
  - For patients on rifampicin, increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily during TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after completion.
  - DTG can be taken with or without food.

- **Common Side Effects:**
  - Headache, nausea, and diarrhea are common but usually resolve after 1-2 weeks.
  - Insomnia may occur; taking DTG in the morning or with a low-fat meal may help.
  - DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels, which does not indicate a decline in renal function.
  - Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain; patients should be counseled on healthy eating and physical activity.

- **Monitoring and Changing ART:**
  - Clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART aims to identify and manage inter-current illnesses, adverse drug reactions, and treatment response.
  - Regimen optimization may be considered for patients with suppressed viral load to prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness.
  - Discuss potential new side effects with patients when changing ARVs, reassuring them that most side effects resolve after 1-2 weeks.",0.9615384615384616,0.8877771802126048,27.57,cosine,gpt-4o

- **Renal Impairment:**
  - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min, especially when used in combination with lamivudine (3TC).
  - Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is associated with renal toxicity, although to a lesser degree than TDF, and should be used cautiously in patients with renal issues.

- **Drug Interactions:**
  - TDF should not be used with didanosine (ddI) due to potential adverse interactions.
  - TDF should not be used in triple nucleoside combinations with 3TC and ddI or abacavir (ABC).
  - When TDF is used with atazanavir (ATV), it significantly reduces ATV levels, so it should be combined with ritonavir (RTV) to boost ATV levels.
  - TAF levels are increased by RTV and cobicistat, and decreased by darunavir (DRV). Boosted protease inhibitors (PI) increase TAF levels, but PI levels are not affected.

- **Hepatitis B Considerations:**
  - Patients should ideally be screened for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before starting TDF or TAF therapy, as exacerbation of hepatitis B has been reported upon discontinuation of these drugs.

- **Overlapping Toxicities:**
  - TDF is associated with nephrotoxicity, which is a concern when used with other nephrotoxic agents like acyclovir, aminoglycosides, and amphotericin B.

These points highlight the importance of monitoring renal function and potential drug interactions when considering the use of tenofovir, as well as the need for caution in patients with existing renal impairment or those at risk of hepatitis B exacerbation.",1.0,0.9744908345798189,16.54,cosine,gpt-4o
How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '## 8.4.

- **TB as a Leading Cause of Morbidity and Mortality:**
  - TB is a significant cause of illness and death among people living with HIV (PLHIV).
  - Early identification and treatment of TB, along with optimal HIV treatment, are crucial.

- **Counseling and Prevention:**
  - PLHIV should receive counseling on TB risks, exposure reduction, symptom recognition, and the importance of seeking care.
  - TB preventive therapy (TPT) should be considered for those without active TB.

- **TB Screening and Intensified Case Finding (ICF):**
  - TB screening should be conducted at every clinical visit using symptom-based ICF tools.
  - Positive screenings require further diagnostic evaluation, while negative screenings should consider TPT eligibility.

- **ART Initiation and Timing:**
  - For patients not on ART, start TB treatment immediately and initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, ideally within 2 weeks.
  - Delay ART for 4 to 8 weeks in cases of TB meningitis.
  - For patients already on ART, continue ART while starting TB treatment, monitoring for treatment failure and drug interactions.

- **Monitoring and Management:**
  - Close monitoring for Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) is necessary.
  - Patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) and HIV should be managed in specialized settings with experienced clinicians.

- **Preferred ART Regimens:**
  - For newly initiating ART in TB/HIV co-infection, specific regimens are recommended based on age and weight.
  - Adjustments to ART regimens may be necessary during rifampicin-containing TB treatment, such as increasing the frequency of dolutegravir (DTG) dosing.

- **ART Adjustments for Patients Developing TB:**
  - For those on protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimens, switching to DTG is recommended.
  - If switching to DTG is not possible, alternative adjustments include ritonavir super-boosting or switching to efavirenz (EFV)-based ART.
  - For raltegravir (RAL)-based regimens, switch to double-dose DTG during TB treatment.

- **Infection Control in Healthcare Settings:**

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '### Table 3.6 Cont.\n\n| Test                                   | Recommended | Frequency/Indication                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| CrAg                                   | ✔           | Baseline for adults and adolescents with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³ (as reflex testing by laboratory), then only if there is clinical suspicion of CM                                                                   |\n| Hb                                     | ✔           | Baseline, then symptom directed; if on AZT, baseline then weeks 2, 4, and 12                                                                                                                                     |\n| Pregnancy Status                       | ✔           | At every visit for women of reproductive age (by history +/- urine pregnancy test)                                                                                                                               |\n| Urinalysis (protein & glucose)         | ✔           | Baseline, then annually if on TDF                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Creatinine                             | ✔           | Baseline, then annually if on TDF                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Glucose                                | ✔           | Baseline, then annually                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Plasma lipid profile                   | ✔           | Baseline, then annually                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| HBsAg                                  | ✔           | Baseline, followed by immunization for all patients who screen negative (after viral suppression is confirmed)                                                                                                   |\n| Syphilis serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR) | ✔           | Baseline, then annually in those at risk and as part of routine ANC profile                                                                                                                                      |\n| Drug Resistance Testing                |             | DRT recommended once treatment failure confirmed on a DTG- or PI-based 1st line regimen, or confirmed treatment failure on 2nd line or subsequent regimens                                                       |\n| ALT                                    |             | Not recommended for routine baseline or follow-up unless specific clinical indication                                                                                                                            |\n| Cervical Cancer                        |             | All women should be screened for cervical cancer following the national guidelines.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review. Aligning']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding lab tests used to monitor ART from the provided source texts:

- **Baseline and Routine Monitoring Tests:**
  - **CD4 Testing:** Essential for diagnosing Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) and determining eligibility for care packages. Conducted as a baseline test for all PLHIV, especially for new clients initiating ART and those reinitiating after treatment interruption.
  - **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Baseline and symptom-directed testing, especially important for patients on AZT. Follow-up at weeks 2, 4, and 12.
  - **Creatinine:** Baseline and annual testing, particularly for patients on TDF, to calculate Creatinine Clearance (CrCl).
  - **Urinalysis (Protein & Glucose):** Baseline and annual testing for all patients, especially those on TDF.
  - **Glucose and Plasma Lipid Profile:** Baseline and annual testing for all patients.
  - **HBsAg:** Baseline testing for all adolescent and adult patients, followed by immunization for those who screen negative.
  - **Syphilis Serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR):** Baseline and annual testing for sexually active patients and those at risk.
  - **HCV Antibody:** Baseline testing for patients with a history of injection drug use.

- **Specialized Tests:**
  - **CrAg (Cryptococcal Antigen):** Baseline testing for adults and adolescents with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³, and if there is clinical suspicion of cryptococcal meningitis.
  - **Pregnancy Status:** Assessed at every visit for women of reproductive age, using history and/or urine pregnancy test.
  - **HPV Testing:** Conducted every two years for women of reproductive age between 25-49 years, following cancer screening guidelines.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - **ALT Testing:** Not recommended routinely unless there is a specific clinical indication, such as a history of liver disease or use of hepatotoxic drugs.
  - **Drug Resistance Testing:** Recommended after confirmed treatment failure on specific ART regimens.
  - **Cervical Cancer Screening:** Recommended for all women following national guidelines, using HPV screening every two years for HIV-positive women.

- **General Guidelines:**
  - Laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring but should not delay ART initiation.
  - Facilities lacking on-site testing capabilities should arrange for specimen transport to reference laboratories.
  - Differentiated care models are suggested for children, adolescents, and pregnant/breastfeeding women to address unique challenges in retention and viral suppression.",1.0,0.9548969396802499,24.59,cosine,gpt-4o
When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","Here is a detailed summary of the most relevant points regarding the initiation of second-line ART based on the provided source texts:

- **General Guidelines for Second-line ART Initiation:**
  - Second-line ART is initiated when a patient fails a first-line regimen, confirmed by a Drug Resistance Test (DRT).
  - Non-adherence is the most common cause of treatment failure; adherence issues must be addressed before confirming treatment failure.
  - Daily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to ensure excellent adherence before repeating the viral load (VL) test.
  - If a drug in the recommended second-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG for guidance.

- **Specific Considerations for Different Patient Groups:**
  - **Infants and Children:**
    - Second-line ART management is more complex in children; thorough clinical and psychosocial assessments are necessary to rule out non-adherence or inter-current illness.
    - All children failing first-line ART should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) and with an experienced ART provider before switching to second-line ART.
    - Limited options for infants and children may require consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG and possibly a DRT to determine the most suitable regimen.

  - **Adults and Adolescents:**
    - For those ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old, a DRT-based second-line regimen is recommended.
    - Pregnant and breastfeeding women should have a sample taken for DRT and switch to a temporary regimen while awaiting results.

- **Second-line ART Treatment Failure:**
  - Confirm treatment failure with viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm.
  - After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), address all causes of poor adherence and other possible causes of viremia.
  - If the second VL remains ≥ 50 copies/ml after 3 months of excellent adherence, continue the failing regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia.
  - Persistent viremia requires consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG and likely a DRT to design a suitable third-line regimen.
  - Enhanced adherence support is crucial, including assigning a case manager, frequent adherence counseling, and addressing mental health and substance use disorders.

- **Regimen Adjustments:**
  - If the regimen itself is the primary cause of poor adherence due to unmanageable side effects, it may need modification in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.

- **Special Cases:**
  - For patients with HIV/HBV co-infection, TDF should always be maintained to treat both HBV and HIV.
  - For TB/HIV co-infection, refer to specific guidelines for ART regimens in such cases.",1.0,0.913401561276408,26.46,cosine,gpt-4o

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","Here is a detailed summary of the recommended adherence strategies for HIV/AIDS treatment based on the provided source texts:

- **Adherence Monitoring Strategies:**
  - **Subjective (Self-reported Adherence):**
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 at every patient visit to assess adherence.
    - Use the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 when adherence problems are suspected.
  
  - **Objective Monitoring:**
    - Conduct pill counts at every visit until viral suppression is confirmed and whenever adherence issues are suspected.
    - Review pharmacy refill records at every drug pick-up and when adherence issues are suspected.
    - Monitor viral load following specific algorithms, with different frequencies based on age and pregnancy status.

- **Home Visits:**
  - Observe medication storage and usage during home visits to understand barriers to adherence. Conduct unscheduled visits only with prior patient consent.

- **Provider-Patient Relationship:**
  - Develop a collaborative, non-judgmental relationship with patients to accurately assess adherence.
  - Regularly inquire about adherence in an open and inquisitive manner to avoid patients providing socially desirable responses.

- **Training and Support:**
  - Train all providers in adherence assessment and support.
  - Refer patients with significant adherence challenges to specialized providers for enhanced support.
  - Involve experienced colleagues and multidisciplinary teams for complex cases, and consult mental health teams if necessary.

- **Adherence Preparation and Support:**
  - Begin adherence strategies at the point of HIV diagnosis and continue throughout the follow-up period.
  - Tailor adherence support to the patient's level of adherence and stage of ART initiation.
  - Ensure follow-up is provided by the same care provider or team to maintain consistency, especially in the initial months of care.

- **ART Initiation and Follow-up:**
  - Provide HIV education and adherence preparation at the enrolment visit.
  - Assess ART readiness and create individualized adherence support plans.
  - Schedule follow-up appointments to review adherence and side effects, especially in the first few weeks after ART initiation.
  - Monitor adherence at every visit and provide counseling based on adherence levels until the first viral load test at 3 months.

- **Viral Load Monitoring:**
  - Continue adherence assessment and counseling if the viral load is undetectable.
  - If the viral load is ≥ 200 copies/ml, suspect poor adherence, assess barriers, and follow enhanced adherence interventions.",1.0,0.93757242107593,34.22,cosine,gpt-4o

- **Dietary Considerations:**
  - Preferably taken on an empty stomach.
  - Can be taken with food, but high-fat meals should be avoided as they increase absorption.

- **Major Side Effects:**
  - Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms: somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia, etc.
  - Skin rash.
  - Avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy.
  - Avoid in patients with a history of psychiatric disease due to potential exacerbation of symptoms.

- **Drug-Drug Interactions:**
  - **Antiretrovirals:**
    - Co-administration with dolutegravir (DTG) is not recommended as EFV decreases DTG levels. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
    - Co-administration with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) is not recommended as EFV decreases ATV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.
    - Avoid co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) due to increased risk of prolonged-QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death.
    - Co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) is not recommended as DRV/r may increase EFV levels, leading to toxicity, and EFV decreases DRV/r levels, potentially leading to resistance and treatment failure.

  - **Antifungals:**
    - Voriconazole: EFV increases voriconazole levels by 44% and decreases voriconazole levels by 77%. This combination is not recommended.

  - **Anti-Mycobacterials:**
    - Rifampicin: EFV levels decrease by 25%. Consider increasing EFV dose to 800 mg daily.

  - **Oral Contraceptives:**
    - EFV decreases ethinyl estradiol levels by 37%. Use alternative or additional contraceptive methods.

- **Other Considerations:**
  - Can be used with rifampicin in tuberculosis (TB) patients, but dose adjustments may be necessary.
  - Monitor for potential hepatotoxicity when used with other hepatotoxic drugs.

These points highlight the importance of careful consideration of drug interactions and patient history when prescribing efavirenz.",1.0,0.9573396686821045,19.73,cosine,gpt-4o
Can HIV be managed with a two-drug regimen?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## Table 6.11: Possible Third-line ART in Children, Adolescents and Adults\n\n|          | Possible 3ʳᵈ Line Regimen        | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Children | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                | Third line ART selection is based on DRT results<br/><br/>Note that the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG may recommend reusing some of the ARVs the patient has already failed, even when resistance is present |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + ABC (or TDF) + 3TC + DRV/r |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Adults   | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF (or AZT) + 3TC         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n\n\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE']","- HIV can be managed with a two-drug regimen, specifically using Dolutegravir (DTG) and Lamivudine (3TC), as part of a third-line ART option for both children and adults.
- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication to undetectable levels, and all individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART regardless of various factors, provided they are willing and ready to start.
- ART should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally on the same day or within two weeks.
- Adherence to ART is crucial, and support should be tailored to the patient's needs, with continuous monitoring and counseling even if viral suppression is achieved.
- Treatment failure is suspected with a viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least three months of ART, and confirmed if VL remains high after addressing adherence issues.
- Third-line ART regimens may include reusing some ARVs the patient has previously failed, based on drug resistance testing (DRT) results.
- For children and adolescents, transitioning to the preferred first-line ART regimen is recommended if they are virally suppressed but not on the preferred regimen.",0.8666666666666667,0.8709123354421529,12.19,cosine,gpt-4o

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","To handle treatment failure in HIV/AIDS management, the following points from the guidelines should be considered:

- **Understanding and Education:**
  - Assess the patient's understanding of key terms like 'viral load', 'high viral load', and 'suppressed viral load'.
  - Provide education on the implications of a detectable viral load and the importance of adherence to ART.

- **Enhanced Adherence Counselling:**
  - Conduct at least three adherence counselling sessions for patients with high viral loads to identify causes and improve adherence.
  - Discuss potential reasons for treatment failure, such as adherence issues, drug interactions, or resistance.

- **Assessing Barriers to Adherence:**
  - **Cognitive Barriers:** Evaluate the patient's knowledge about HIV, ART, and the importance of adherence.
  - **Behavioral Barriers:** Review the patient's medication-taking routine and identify any issues with timing or routine disruptions.
  - Discuss the use of reminder tools and strategies for managing travel and side effects.
  - Address any substance use that may affect adherence.

- **Consequences of Non-Adherence:**
  - Explain that stopping or irregularly taking ART can lead to increased viral load, reduced immunity, and drug resistance.
  - Highlight that resistance leads to treatment failure, necessitating stronger, more expensive ART with potential for more side effects.

- **Managing Side Effects:**
  - Educate patients on common side effects and the importance of continuing ART despite mild side effects.
  - Advise patients to seek immediate medical advice for severe side effects.

- **Adherence Strategies:**
  - Emphasize the importance of following the care plan, attending appointments, and taking medications as prescribed.
  - Ensure patients understand the correct dosage and timing for ART, and the importance of not sharing medications.
  - Provide guidance on managing missed doses and adhering to dietary restrictions associated with ART.

By addressing these areas, healthcare providers can effectively manage treatment failure and support patients in achieving better health outcomes.",1.0,0.8882056939754878,30.58,cosine,gpt-4o

co-infection based on the provided source texts:

- **Resistance Testing Importance**: Resistance testing is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment regimen for TB, especially in the context of HIV/AIDS co-infection. It helps in identifying drug-resistant TB strains, which require different treatment approaches.

- **GeneXpert Testing**: This is a primary diagnostic tool used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampicin resistance. It is essential for initial screening and helps guide further testing and treatment decisions.

- **Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)**: 
  - **First Line (FL) and Second Line (SL) DST**: These tests are conducted to determine the susceptibility of TB strains to first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs. They are critical for tailoring treatment regimens, especially in drug-resistant TB (DR TB) cases.
  - **Line Probe Assay (LPA)**: Used alongside culture tests to provide a comprehensive resistance profile, aiding in the adjustment of treatment regimens.

- **High-Risk Groups for DR TB**: 
  - Patients with a history of TB treatment failures, relapses, or loss to follow-up.
  - Contacts of DR TB patients.
  - Patients with positive smear results at specific treatment milestones (e.g., month 2 or 5).
  - Healthcare workers, prisoners, and refugees with TB symptoms.

- **Treatment Adjustments Based on DST Results**: 
  - Initial treatment regimens may be adjusted based on DST results to ensure effectiveness and prevent further resistance.
  - Regular follow-ups and clinical reviews are necessary to monitor treatment response and make necessary adjustments.

- **Follow-up and Surveillance**: 
  - Regular smear and culture tests are mandatory during treatment to monitor progress and detect any resistance development.
  - Clinical review meetings are essential for patients undergoing DR TB treatment to ensure adherence and address any issues promptly.

- **Role in TB/HIV Co-infection**: 
  - Resistance testing is particularly important in TB/HIV co-infected patients due to their increased vulnerability and the potential for rapid disease progression.
  - It helps in optimizing treatment regimens to manage both TB and HIV effectively, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes.

Overall, resistance testing plays a pivotal role in the management of TB, particularly in the context of HIV/AIDS, by guiding treatment decisions and ensuring the use of effective drug regimens.",1.0,0.911609041923655,17.31,cosine,gpt-4o

Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","- Efavirenz:

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.']","- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for all individuals at risk of HIV infection, including adolescent girls.

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '- Follow up smears should be done for all bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases at end of month 2, 5 and 6 of TB treatment using smear microscopy\n\n- Follow up of RR TB and DR TB should be done as per PMDT guidelines\n\n- Patients taking isoniazid containing regimen should also be given Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) daily for the duration of treatment to reduce the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (see Annex 10 for pyridoxine dosing)\n\nOnce TB treatment is started it should be completed; unless another definitive diagnosis (like lung cancer) is established and TB is ruled out.\n\n\n\nTB-LAM is a rapid point-of-care urine dip-stick test that can be performed at the bedside.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['## 5.5 Adherence Monitoring, Counselling and Support for Patients with Unsuppressed Viral Load ≥ 200 copies/ml\n\nTreatment failure should be suspected whenever a patient has been on ART for at least 3 months and has: a viral load ≥ 200 copies/ml; a decline in CD4 count or; any new or worsening clinical condition. Treatment failure is confirmed as per the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6). Poor adherence is often the most important factor in developing treatment failure, though there can be other causes. Adherence must be thoroughly assessed and all issues must be addressed before switching patients to the next line of ART. **Do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed, and a repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after 3 months of excellent adherence.** For patients with high-risk persistent low-level viremia (VL 200 - 999 copies/ml after additional assessment and intervention), consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform).\n\n# 5.5.1 Enhanced Adherence Assessments\n\nAs soon as treatment failure is suspected the patient/caregiver should be discussed by the facility multi-disciplinary team to develop a plan for assessing barriers to adherence (including scheduling a home visit), and assessing other potential causes of treatment failure (e.g., inadequate dosing/dose adjustments, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, impaired absorption e.g., chronic severe diarrhoea).\n\nAll patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure should have a thorough assessment of potential barriers to adherence (Table 5.15).\n\nIf the patient has a caregiver, treatment buddy, and/or spouse/partner who is enrolled in HIV care, that person’s file should also be reviewed to confirm their most recent viral load results and adherence.\n\n# 5.5.2 Enhanced Adherence Counselling\n\nAdherence assessment and enhanced adherence counselling should begin as soon as a detectable viral load (≥ 200 copies/ml) is received, preferably within 2 weeks.\n\nThe goal of Enhanced Adherence Counselling is to assess possible barriers to adherence in a non-judgmental way and to help the patient construct an adherence plan with concrete objectives. It is important not to focus solely on knowledge of HIV and ART but also to review psychological, emotional, and socio-economic factors that may contribute to poor adherence. In addition, exploring the patient’s motivation for taking medication often highlights reasons for poor adherence.\n\nAt least three sessions of Enhanced Adherence Counselling, spaced 2-4 weeks apart, are recommended as the minimum number of sessions, but additional sessions can be added as needed (Table 5.18). If the adherence is evaluated as adequate, a repeat viral load is done after three months of excellent adherence, and another Enhanced Adherence Counselling session is conducted to discuss the viral load results. A detailed content guide for Enhanced Adherence Counselling is provided in Annex 9.\n\nIt is preferable to have the patient go through all adherence counselling sessions with the same counsellor in order to provide continuity, and that the session is documented to ensure follow-up of all issues identified.\n\nIf adequate adherence cannot be achieved then consult with a senior clinician, discuss as an MDT, or consult the Regional or National TWG.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","- Treatment failure should be suspected when a patient has been on ART for at least 3 months and has a viral load ≥ 200 copies/ml, a decline in CD4 count, or any new or worsening clinical condition.

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, immune reconstitution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) administered prior to conception.\n* Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case manager and/or mentor mother\n* Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care\n* Pregnancy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.\n* Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregnant women should receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary feeding (Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an |', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

When should infants start ART?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', ""# Table 5.4 Cont.\n\n# B. Support Systems Criteria (applies to patients and caregivers)\n\n1. Has identified convenient time/s of day for taking ART, and/or associated dose/s with daily event/s?\n2. Treatment supporter has been identified and engaged in HIV education, or will attend next counselling session?\n3. Is aware of support group meeting time/s?\n4. If facility has SMS reminder system: Has enrolled into SMS reminder system?\n5. Other support systems are in place or planned (e.g., setting phone alarm, pill box)?\n\n# C. Medical Criteria (applies to patients)\n\n1. Newly diagnosed with TB: defer ART until patient tolerates anti-TB medication; initiate ART as soon as possible preferably within 2 weeks; for TB meningitis delay ART for 4 to 8 weeks); monitor closely for IRIS\n2. Newly diagnosed cryptococcal meningitis (CM), or symptoms consistent with CM (progressive headache, fever, malaise, neck pain, confusion): defer ART until completed 5 weeks of CM treatment, or until ruling out CM as the cause of symptoms; monitor closely for IRIS\n\n*If the response to any of the psychosocial criteria or support systems criteria is “No”: develop a strategy to address the issue as quickly as possible and consider assigning a case manager. ART may be initiated with adequate adherence support while the criteria is being addressed, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAt each visit up until ART initiation, every patient should be assessed for readiness to start ART (Table 5.4), with the patient/caregiver allowed to make the final decision on whether and when to start ART.\n\n# Special Considerations when Counselling Children and Adolescents\n\nChildren and adolescents depend on caregivers to support their adherence so there are special considerations for adherence preparation and support. All topics covered in the HIV Education and Adherence Counselling sessions (Table 5.2 and Annex 8) should be covered with the caregiver, with involvement of the child/adolescent as appropriate based on the stage of disclosure and their developmental stage (Table 5.5).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Age-appropriate Involvement of Child/Adolescent in HIV Education and Adherence Counselling\n\n| Age                                                                                                                  | Counselling Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| < 6 years old                                                                                                        | The counselling sessions will focus on engaging all of the child's caregivers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 6-12 years old                                                                                                       | Both the caregiver and the child will be involved.

- ART should be initiated in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (preferably within 2 weeks).
- Preferred first-line ART regimens for infants, children, adolescents, and adults are specified based on age and weight.
- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but not on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition to the preferred regimen.
- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART use, and confirmed when viral load is ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high viral load.
- Support systems criteria for patients and caregivers include identifying convenient times for taking ART, engaging treatment supporters, attending support group meetings, enrolling in SMS reminder systems, and other support systems.
- Medical criteria for patients include considerations for newly diagnosed TB or cryptococcal meningitis before initiating ART.

What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

- Daily Oral PrEP is recommended for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.
- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones.
- PrEP is indicated for HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition, including those in sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive, engaging in transactional sex or sex work, with a history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections, with recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, with a history of sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and more.
- Clients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk using a Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) before initiating PrEP.
- To be eligible for PrEP, individuals must meet criteria such as confirmed HIV negative status, willingness to take PrEP as prescribed, absence of contraindications to ARVs recommended for PrEP, and more.
- Pre-initiation client education should include explaining how PrEP works, the need for baseline and follow-up tests, PrEP use details, limitations of PrEP, risk reduction counseling, and support education.
- The preferred ARV regimen for PrEP is Tenofovir 300mg/ Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) given as one fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet orally daily.
- For Daily Oral PrEP, TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg) as FDC once daily is preferred, while for Event Driven Oral PrEP, TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg) as FDC with a specific dosing schedule is recommended.
- Long-acting products like Cabotegravir Injection and Dapivirine vaginal ring are also mentioned as alternative options for PrEP, pending specific implementation guidelines.",1.0,0.8859245260160158,10.12,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

- After 3 months of treatment, the goal is to have an undetectable viral load
- If viral load is detectable, reasons should be discussed with the patient
- Repeat viral load tests are done every 6 months for children/adolescents and pregnant/breastfeeding individuals, or annually for others
- Viral load should also be measured at the start of treatment for HEI with positive PCR
- An undetectable viral load means the treatment is working well and the virus is not damaging the body
- If viral load is detectable, it indicates the treatment is not working properly, usually due to missed doses
- CD4 count should be measured at the beginning of treatment to assess risk of opportunistic infections

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1.

See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6.

Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available']","- Dolutegravir (DTG) is safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) should discuss pregnancy intention, and family planning counseling should be offered to those who do not wish to become pregnant.
- DTG dosing may need to be adjusted for patients taking rifampicin, with an increase to 50 mg twice daily for patients >20 kg in body weight.
- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other anti-TB medications.
- Mineral supplements and antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium, or aluminum can decrease DTG absorption, so DTG should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking these supplements.
- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin can decrease DTG levels, and alternative anticonvulsants should be considered if available.
- Metformin levels may increase with DTG, so a lower dose of metformin should be used and glycemic control monitored.
- Patients on DTG should be monitored for inter-current illnesses, adverse drug reactions, and treatment response.
- Patients who are virally suppressed on first-line ART may benefit from regimen optimization, with DTG being preferred due to its tolerability and efficacy.
- Common side effects of DTG include headache, nausea, and diarrhea, which usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks.
- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels, but this does not indicate a decline in renal function.

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '## 8.4.

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']","- Second-line ART should be initiated if any drug in the recommended first-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated

- Patients failing second-line ART should have limited options and may require a third-line regimen, which can be more expensive and have increased pill burden and side effects
- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","- Adherence monitoring strategies include subjective (self-reported adherence) and objective methods
- Subjective methods include using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 at every visit and when adherence problems are suspected
- Objective methods include pill counts at every visit until confirmed viral suppression and when adherence problems are suspected, pharmacy refill records at every drug pick-up and when adherence problems are suspected, and viral load monitoring according to specific timelines based on age and pregnancy status
- It is important to observe where and how a patient stores and takes their medications, conduct home visits with patient consent, and develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients to accurately assess adherence
- Adherence support strategies should be implemented from the point of HIV diagnosis and tailored to the patient's level of adherence, stage of ART initiation, and follow-up stage
- Adherence preparation should begin at the time of HIV testing and close follow-up is required after ART initiation
- Follow-up should ideally be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers at each visit, especially during the first few months of HIV care.",1.0,0.9070060439096105,9.68,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

- The recommended dose for adults is 600mg once daily, preferably taken at bedtime.
- EFV should preferably be taken on an empty stomach, but can be taken with food, avoiding high-fat meals that increase absorption.
- Major side effects of EFV include CNS symptoms (somnolence, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, hallucination, amnesia), skin rash, and should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.
- EFV can be used with rifampicin in TB patients.
- Contraindications to EFV include a history of psychiatric disease and the first trimester of pregnancy.
- Efavirenz (EFV) decreases the plasma levels of dolutegravir (DTG), so co-administration is not recommended unless DTG is increased to 50 mg twice daily.
- EFV decreases the serum concentration of atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), leading to resistance and treatment failure, so co-administration is not recommended.
- EFV decreases the levels of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), increasing the risk of prolonged-QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, so this combination should be avoided.
- EFV decreases the serum concentration of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), leading to resistance and treatment failure, so co-administration is not recommended.",1.0,0.888086064294138,7.86,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders']","- HIV can be managed with a two-drug regimen, but in cases where patients fail first-line or second-line ART, more complex regimens may be necessary.
- Second-line ART in infants and children requires thorough assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for high viral load.
- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options and may require consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG for a third-line regimen.

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose).

(e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","- Treatment failure occurs when the virus becomes resistant to the ART, leading to the ART no longer being effective.
- Patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure should undergo enhanced adherence counseling sessions to address potential reasons for high viral load.
- Assessing possible barriers to adherence, including cognitive barriers such as knowledge about HIV and ART, and behavioral barriers such as medication timing, reminder tools, travel planning, side effects management, and substance use.
- Emphasize the importance of taking ART as prescribed to avoid treatment failure and the development of resistance.
- If treatment failure occurs, stronger and more expensive ART may be necessary, potentially with more pills and increased side effects.
- Severe side effects from ART should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.
- Adherence to ART involves following the prescribed care plan, attending clinic appointments, picking up and taking medications as directed, and getting lab tests as recommended.
- ART should be taken at the correct dosage, time of day, and with or without food as specified. Missing a dose should be rectified as soon as remembered without doubling up on doses.",1.0,0.8977472480354853,6.9,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
When is regimen switching appropriate?,"['Adherence support systems will need to be adapted to patients’ specific needs and the context (Table 5.18). Special attention needs to be given to children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients with mental health disorders and substance users.\n\n# 5.6 Treatment Preparation for 2nd Line or 3rd Line ART\n\nAfter confirming treatment failure and making the decision to start 2nd line or 3rd line ART (based on discussion as an MDT, and in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG), the patient requires targeted counselling and education to prepare them for the new regimen and to support ongoing adherence (Figure 5.2).\n\n- Review the patient file\n- Review patient file\n- Confirm all the barriers to adherence have been addressed during Enhanced Adherence Counselling, if not – address remaining barriers before considering changing regimens\n- Assess patient’s knowledge and understanding\n- HIV, viral load and ART\n- The importance of good adherence and potential problems of non-adherence\n- Reasons for switching to 2nd or 3rd line ART: treatment failure with repeated high viral load\n- Provide patient education\n- Strengthen key messages on HIV and viral load\n- Provide information on 2nd/3rd line ART: more complex to take (more pills, twice-a-day dosing), very limited options if this fails\n- Provide simple take-home IEC materials on 2nd or 3rd line ART management\n- Construct adherence plan\n- Confirm patient’s willingness to start new regimen\n- Ensure that the patient understands the treatment plan (drug regimen, dosing schedule, dietary restrictions, potential side effects, what to do when missing doses or experiencing side effects)\n- Prepare for situations that could impair good adherence, and encourage disclosure of poor adherence\n- Plan sessions with the pharmacist on medication adherence, and nutritionist on nutritional aspects\n\nEnsure a monthly follow-up counselling session during clinic visits for the first 6 months after initiating the new regimen\n\n- Ensure monthly counselling follow-up sessions\n- Follow up on problems identified during the previous sessions\n- Assess patient’s adherence and explore any reasons for poor adherence. Identify strategies to overcome these barriers\n- Repeat VL after 3 months on new regimen\n- If VL undetectable: adherence counselling every 3 months\n- If VL is detectable: discuss as MDT and consult Clinical TWG', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","- Adherence support systems should be tailored to specific patient needs and contexts, including children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients with mental health disorders, and substance users.

What is the role of resistance testing?,"['# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women', 'Refer to the CXR algorithm for TB diagnosis ⁴ MTB detected Trace – Results from sample with few bacilli (paucibacillary TB).
