Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available']","Important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) include:

- **Efavirenz**: Decreases DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily if used together.
- **Etravirine**: Not recommended without a protease inhibitor/ritonavir; otherwise, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
- **Rifampicin**: Lowers DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients over 20 kg, and adjust for children under 20 kg.
- **Rifapentine**: Potentially decreases DTG levels; increase DTG to twice daily if viral load becomes detectable.
- **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**: Decrease DTG levels; avoid use or increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily if necessary.
- **Mineral Supplements and Antacids**: Decrease DTG absorption; administer DTG 2 hours before or 6 hours after these supplements, unless taken with a meal for calcium and iron.
- **Metformin**: DTG increases metformin levels; consider reducing metformin dose to a maximum of 1,000 mg daily.

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.', '##

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', 'For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI management.\n\n# 8.2.1. Indications for TPT\n\nTPT should be provided to those patients in whom TB is excluded (using the ICF tool) and meet the eligibility criteria to initiate TPT. The following client categories are eligible for TPT who screen negative for active TB:\n\n- All PLHIV above 12 months of age (children, adolescents and adults including pregnant and breastfeeding women)\n- All household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB\n- Prisoners and staff working in prison setting\n- Health care workers and other staff in health care setting\n- Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines\n\nNeonates born to mothers with TB, or exposed to close contacts with TB should be given TPT once TB disease has been ruled out. BCG should be given 2 weeks after completion of TPT or anti-TB treatment.\n\n# Summary of recommendations for TPT among the PLHIV\n\n- PLHIV are at a much higher risk of getting TB disease compared to the general population.\n- TB preventive therapy should be given to all PLHIV above 12 months of age who do not have active TB disease.

Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive for syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and ensure they are treated for syphilis.\n\nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after birth.\n\n# 7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).\n\nRefer to Chapter 9 for management of HIV/HBV coinfection.\n\n\n\n# Table 7.3: ARV Prophylaxis for HIV-Exposed Infants\n\n| Infant Scenario    | Infant Prophylaxis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maternal Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| HIV Exposed Infant | * Infant prophylaxis\n\n  * AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP + cotrimoxazole should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding\n  * Infant prophylaxis can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP if the child is not breastfeeding (death of mother or separation with mother)\n  * The infant prophylaxis regimen applies to all infants irrespective of age when identifying HIV exposure (e.g., mother diagnosed HIV-positive in the postpartum period)\n\n* DBS or whole blood for PCR at 6 weeks or first contact, following EID algorithm (Figure 2.1)\n\n* Birth testing (Figure 2.2) may be conducted in sites where point of care has been implemented and when medically indicated | - If mother not on ART, initiate ART as soon as possible (preferably same day)\n- If mother is on ART for ≥ 3 months and the VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, intensify adherence, repeat the VL\n- If VL <50 copies/ml, continue current regimen\n- Follow Viral load algorithm Figure 6.6 |']","Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is indicated for HIV-exposed infants, who should receive it until 6 weeks after breastfeeding cessation.",1.0,0.9259698154891471,29.25,llm,gpt-4o
What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","The guidelines for ART failure include the following key points:

1. **Definition and Causes:**
   - ART failure is indicated by a viral load of ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART use, which must be confirmed by addressing adherence issues and retesting.

2. **Adherence:**
   - Poor adherence is a major cause of treatment failure. Enhanced adherence counseling is recommended to identify and address barriers.

3. **Management:**
   - Do not change ART regimens until the reasons for treatment failure are identified and addressed.
   - Use a case-management approach to urgently address the causes of treatment failure.

4. **Monitoring and Support:**
   - Continuously monitor and support adherence, even in patients with viral suppression.
   - Systems should be in place to promptly identify and address missed appointments.

These guidelines emphasize the importance of adherence, the need for thorough evaluation before changing ART regimens, and the implementation of support systems to manage and prevent ART failure.",0.6666666666666666,0.9999999999999996,17.85,llm,gpt-4o

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, immune reconstitution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) administered prior to conception.\n* Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case manager and/or mentor mother\n* Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care\n* Pregnancy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.\n* Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregnant women should receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary feeding (Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an |', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).\n\nRefer to Chapter 9 for management of HIV/HBV coinfection.\n\n\n\n# Table 7.3: ARV Prophylaxis for HIV-Exposed Infants\n\n| Infant Scenario    | Infant Prophylaxis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maternal Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| HIV Exposed Infant | * Infant prophylaxis\n\n  * AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP + cotrimoxazole should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding\n  * Infant prophylaxis can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP if the child is not breastfeeding (death of mother or separation with mother)\n  * The infant prophylaxis regimen applies to all infants irrespective of age when identifying HIV exposure (e.g., mother diagnosed HIV-positive in the postpartum period)\n\n* DBS or whole blood for PCR at 6 weeks or first contact, following EID algorithm (Figure 2.1)\n\n* Birth testing (Figure 2.2) may be conducted in sites where point of care has been implemented and when medically indicated | - If mother not on ART, initiate ART as soon as possible (preferably same day)\n- If mother is on ART for ≥ 3 months and the VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, intensify adherence, repeat the VL\n- If VL <50 copies/ml, continue current regimen\n- Follow Viral load algorithm Figure 6.6 |']","To manage HIV in pregnancy, initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, using TDF/3TC/DTG as the first-line regimen, and continue it lifelong.

When should infants start ART?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '- All HIV exposed infants (HEI) should be tested with DNA PCR within 6 weeks of age or first contact thereafter; if negative then another DNA PCR at 6 months, and if negative then repeat DNA PCR at 12 months.\n- All HEI should receive infant ARV prophylaxis consisting of 6 weeks of AZT + NVP and thereafter NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.\n- All infants irrespective of HIV status should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life, with timely introduction of appropriate complementary foods after 6 months, and continued breastfeeding up to 24 months or beyond.\n\n# 1.7 TB/HIV Co-infection Prevention and Management\n\n- All healthcare settings should implement TB infection control recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of TB among patients, visitors and staff.\n- Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed for all PLHIV at every clinic visit\n- Patients who screen negative should be assessed for and provided with TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n- Patients who screen positive (presumptive TB) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways.\n- The GeneXpert Ultra MTB/Rif test is the preferred test for diagnosis of TB and rifampicin resistance in all presumptive TB cases.\n- TB-LAM can be used as an adjunct rapid point-of-care diagnostic test for PLHIV: with advanced HIV disease (WHO stage 3 or 4 or CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm³ (or CD4% ≤ 25% for children ≤ 5 years)) with presumptive TB, or; any danger signs of severe illness, or; currently admitted to hospital.\n- Patients diagnosed with TB/HIV co-infection should start anti-TB treatment immediately and initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks (unless they have TB meningitis, in which case ART should be deferred for 4 to 8 weeks).\n- Patients with TB/HIV co-infection who are already on ART should start anti-TB treatment immediately and continue ART, making any required adjustments to the ART regimen based on known drug-drug interactions and monitoring toxicity.\n- Always assess for ART failure in patients who develop TB after being on ART for ≥ 6 months.', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2.

For adults a normal CD4 count is above 500\n- How are CD4 cells affected by HIV\n- HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells\n- After years of constant attack from HIV, the CD4 count falls\n- What happens when CD4 cells decrease\n- When the CD4 count falls too low (usually below 200), diseases called “opportunistic infections” are able to infect the body because the body cannot defend itself\n- Common opportunistic infections include: tuberculosis, pneumonia, skin problems, white spots in the mouth, and chronic diarrhoea\n- How often is CD4 count measured\n- CD4 count is measured for all patients at the beginning of treatment, to see if you are likely to get any opportunistic infections\n- Once you start treatment for HIV, we do not need to check CD4 count frequently, but we will use\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.', '## 3.5 Follow-up of PLHIV after ART initiation\n\nFollow-up of patients on ART is determined by the duration the patient has been on treatment, how well they understand the treatment and their response to ART. Follow-up includes scheduled clinical appointments, unscheduled clinical assessments for patients with concerns/complaints, routine and as-needed laboratory monitoring.\n\n\n\n## 3.5.1 First 6 months after ART initiation\n\nAfter ART initiation, patients need to be monitored closely for development of adverse drug events, identify and address barriers to adherence, and development of IRIS. A reasonable follow-up schedule for most patients is 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ART initiation (Table 3.5 and 3.6).\n\nWhen possible, follow-up for a particular patient should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 6 months in care.\n\n## 3.5.2 Differentiated Service Delivery for Patients beyond the 1st 6 months of ART\n\nFollow up of patients beyond 6 months of ART is described in table 3.5. It also provides the criteria for determining if a patient is established on ART.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Patients who are not established on ART require closer follow-up.\n- Patients who are established on ART require less frequent facility follow-up, with up to six months between clinical appointments\n\n### Table 3.5: Differentiated Follow-up of Patients Beyond the First 6 Months of ART\n\n| Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Patients with any of the following:- On treatment for < 6 months\n- Any active OIs (including TB) in the previous 6 months\n- Poor or questionable adherence to scheduled clinic visits in the previous 6 months.\n- Most recent VL ≥ 200 copies/ml\n- Children < 2 years |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Package of Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | * Standard Package of Care\n* Case management to address reason/s for not being established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Focus of Counselling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women']","The preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for adults is a combination of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and Dolutegravir (DTG), with the dosing being TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tablet once daily.",1.0,0.9553117395552628,18.75,llm,gpt-4o

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '## 8.4.

All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results;

you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","Second-line ART is initiated when a patient experiences treatment failure on a first-line regimen, confirmed by a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) to guide the selection of the second-line regimen.",1.0,0.9880966819156303,24.69,llm,gpt-4o
What adherence strategies are recommended?,"['- Religious beliefs: find out if the patient has tried faith healing, or if they have ever stopped taking their medicine because of their religious beliefs.\n\nAnnex 9A: Cont.\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Review the patient’s file to determine if they have been referred to other services. This includes referrals to social services, support groups, psychology services, nutrition services, medical clinics, substance abuse groups, etc.\n- Ask the patient if they attended the appointments, check in on their experience with the referral services and re-organize referrals as necessary.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to develop a plan that addresses each of the issues. It is important to let the patient come up with the solutions so that they can own them.\n- Some examples of addressing adherence challenges:\n- - Behavioural barriers: using a reminder tool; using a pill box; redefining the medication schedule to fit with the patient’s daily schedule; keeping an emergency dose of drugs when away from home.\n- Refer to clinician in case of side effects.\n- Socio-economical barriers: move on to disclosure process; identify a treatment buddy; join a support group; refer to CBO/NGO to learn about income generating activities.\n- Emotional barriers: emotional support or refer to clinician for mental health management.\n\nAgree on a follow-up date for the next session.\n\n# Session 2 (usually 2 weeks after Session 1, preferably with the same provider)\n\n# Review Adherence Plan\n\n- Ask the patient if he/she thinks adherence has improved since the last visit. Enquire in a friendly way if any doses have been missed.\n- Review the patient’s barriers to adherence documented during the first session and if strategies identified have been taken up. If not, discuss why.\n\n# Identify Any New Issues\n\n- Discuss specific reasons why the patient may have missed their pills or a clinic appointment since the last counselling session, and determine if it is a new issue that wasn’t addressed during the first session.\n- Discuss if other issues have come up because of implementing the adherence plan (e.g., perhaps the disclosure process had unintended results).\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Follow-up on any referrals made during the previous session.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to modify their original adherence plan to address each of the issues. It is important to let the patient come up with the solutions so that they own them.\n- Give another short motivational speech on how you believe in the patient! You know they can do this!

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","The recommended adherence strategies for HIV/AIDS management include:

1. **Religious and Cultural Considerations:** Assess the impact of religious beliefs on medication adherence.

2. **Referrals and Networking:** Review and follow up on referrals to support services and consider home visits to understand patient barriers.

3. **Developing an Adherence Plan:** Collaboratively address adherence challenges with the patient, addressing specific barriers such as:
   - **Behavioral:** Use reminder tools, pill boxes, adjust schedules, keep emergency doses.
   - **Socio-economic:** Encourage disclosure, find a treatment buddy, join support groups, explore income-generating activities.
   - **Emotional:** Provide emotional support or refer for mental health management.

4. **Adherence Monitoring Strategies:** Use subjective tools like the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, conduct objective assessments through pill counts, pharmacy records, and viral load monitoring, and consider home visits.

5. **Adherence Preparation and Support:** Start adherence support at HIV diagnosis, tailor it to the patient's ART stage, ensure continuity of care, and provide ongoing education and counseling.

6. **Follow-up and Continuous Support:** Regularly review and modify adherence plans, encourage open communication, and involve experienced colleagues and mental health teams for complex cases.",1.0,0.9375146893278644,43.92,llm,gpt-4o

Can HIV be managed with a two-drug regimen?,"[""# 6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART initiation are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n## Table 6.1: Special Considerations for Timing of ART Initiation\n\n| Population                                                   | Timing of ART Initiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Additional Notes                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pregnant and breastfeeding women                             | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Intensive adherence counselling, support and close follow-up required because of limited time for patient preparation   |\n| Infants (< 12 months old)                                    | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV.

If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders']","The guideline excerpts do not explicitly discuss the use of a two-drug regimen for managing HIV.

How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure.

If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders']","To handle treatment failure in HIV/AIDS management:

1. **Address Non-Adherence:** Resolve adherence issues before confirming treatment failure and switching regimens. Implement daily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker.

2. **Second-Line ART Regimens:** Determine second-line regimens based on the first-line regimen, possibly requiring Drug Resistance Testing (DRT). For infants and children, conduct thorough clinical and psychosocial assessments.

3. **Managing Second-Line Treatment Failure:**
   - Confirm failure with viral load testing.
   - Address all causes of poor adherence and other possible causes of viremia.
   - Repeat viral load testing after 3 months of excellent adherence.
   - If viremia persists, consult with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG for guidance on third-line regimens.

4. **Enhanced Adherence Support:** Assign a case manager, provide frequent adherence counseling, and assess and treat any mental health or substance use disorders.

5. **Consultation and Coordination:** Engage with specialized teams for complex cases and regimen adjustments, using the national case summary form and consulting the Uliza Hotline for guidance.",0.9375,0.9138103084052941,21.57,llm,gpt-4o

ADRs can have a significant impact on patient adherence and must be identified early and managed aggressively. All ADRs should be reported to the Pharmacy and Poisons Board using existing pharmacovigilance tools (http://www.pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/). Pharmacovigilance is particularly important for monitoring ADRs associated with any new ARVs that enter the national supply chain, as rare ADRs may appear in routine care, which were not observed in the highly selected patients participating in clinical trials.\n\nThe most common significant ADRs associated with ARVs that may require a drug substitution']","Regimen switching is appropriate in the following situations:

1. **Adherence Issues**: If non-adherence is identified as a cause of treatment failure, adherence issues must be addressed before switching regimens to prevent failure of the new regimen.

2. **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)**: If significant side effects from the current regimen impact adherence, a switch may be necessary.

3. **Viral Load Monitoring**: If the viral load remains high (≥ 200 copies/ml) 3 months after a regimen change, further consultation is advised.

4. **Children and Adolescents**: For those weighing ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old, consider regimen changes if the viral load is ≥ 200 copies/ml after 3 months on ART.

5. **Consultation and Coordination**: Any regimen change should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.",1.0,0.9792266501395646,20.56,llm,gpt-4o

1. **Guiding Treatment Adjustments**: Resistance testing, such as Drug Resistance Testing (DRT) and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST), is crucial for adjusting treatment regimens, particularly in cases of treatment failure or delayed conversion. It ensures that treatment does not proceed to the continuation phase without confirming susceptibility to key drugs like rifampicin and isoniazid.

2. **Initiating Drug-Resistant TB Treatment**: For patients with detected rifampicin resistance, resistance testing results guide the initiation of drug-resistant TB (DR TB) treatment and necessary regimen adjustments.

3. **Prioritizing High-Risk Groups**: High-risk groups for DR TB, such as previously treated TB patients and contacts of DR TB patients, should be prioritized for DST and other diagnostic tests to ensure timely and appropriate treatment.

4. **Ensuring Timely Collection of Samples**: Urgent collection of DRT samples is advised to facilitate timely treatment adjustments, with guidance from the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.

5. **Supporting Comprehensive Review and Evaluation**: Resistance testing supports comprehensive reviews by clinical teams to ensure adherence and address any causes of treatment failure or delayed conversion in patients with DR TB.",1.0,0.9116132917412539,26.04,llm,gpt-4o

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available']","Important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) include:

- **Efavirenz**: Co-administration not recommended as it decreases DTG levels. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
- **Etravirine**: Co-administration not recommended unless used with a PI/r. Without a PI/r, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily. With a PI/r, standard DTG dose is sufficient.
- **Rifampicin**: Increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily when co-administered.
- **Rifapentine**: Potential decreased DTG levels; no dose adjustment required unless viral load becomes detectable.
- **Metformin**: DTG may increase metformin levels; limit daily metformin dose to 1,000 mg.
- **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**: Avoid co-administration as they decrease DTG levels. If necessary, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
- **Mineral supplements and antacids**: Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these to avoid decreased absorption.",1.0,0.9645169828191099,9.74,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.', '# Table 11.7: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\n| Visit                                                                          | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| First (Screening Visit) Clinician Visit                                        | * HIV testing and counselling.\n* Evaluate for eligibility, willingness and readiness to take PrEP.\n* Educate about the risks, benefits, and limitations of different PrEP options\n* Educate client about recognizing symptoms of Acute HIV Infection (AHI) and what to do if such symptoms occur (i.e., urgently return for HIV testing)\n* Conduct behavior risk assessment\n* STI screening and treatment\n* Pregnancy, contraceptive use and counselling (for women); if pregnancy suspected, obtain a pregnancy test.

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', 'For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI management.\n\n# 8.2.1. Indications for TPT\n\nTPT should be provided to those patients in whom TB is excluded (using the ICF tool) and meet the eligibility criteria to initiate TPT. The following client categories are eligible for TPT who screen negative for active TB:\n\n- All PLHIV above 12 months of age (children, adolescents and adults including pregnant and breastfeeding women)\n- All household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB\n- Prisoners and staff working in prison setting\n- Health care workers and other staff in health care setting\n- Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines\n\nNeonates born to mothers with TB, or exposed to close contacts with TB should be given TPT once TB disease has been ruled out. BCG should be given 2 weeks after completion of TPT or anti-TB treatment.\n\n# Summary of recommendations for TPT among the PLHIV\n\n- PLHIV are at a much higher risk of getting TB disease compared to the general population.\n- TB preventive therapy should be given to all PLHIV above 12 months of age who do not have active TB disease. This should be done irrespective of immune status, ART status, previous history of TB and pregnancy status.\n- Children aged &#x3C;12 months living with HIV who are household contacts of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, and whom active TB has been ruled out should receive TB preventive therapy.\n- TPT may be given immediately following successful completion of TB treatment among the PLHIV.\n- Repeat TPT is not recommended among PLHIV except if a PLHIV becomes a household contact of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB.\n- PLHIV aged 15 years and above should be provided with 3 months of weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid (3HP), while those less than 15 years are given 6 months of daily INH (6H).\n- In PLHIV on PI/r-based ART, pregnant women and those who do not tolerate 3HP should be given six months of daily INH (6H).\n- For eligible patients previously treated for TB, initiate TPT upon completion of their TB treatment.\n\n\n\n## 8.2.2. Contraindications to TPT\n\nPatients with the following should not receive TPT until the underlying issue(s) are addressed:\n\n- Active tuberculosis disease\n- Active hepatitis (acute or chronic)\n- Chronic alcohol abuse\n- Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy\n\n## 8.2.3.

Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive for syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and ensure they are treated for syphilis.\n\nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after birth.\n\n# 7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Annex 9 E: Management Protocol for Patients Switching to 3rd Line ART\n\n# Management Protocol for patients switching to 3ʳᵈ line ART\n\n# Pre – Initiation MDT Meeting\n\n- Confirm what 3ʳᵈ line ARV regimen is prescribed, its availability and the management plan\n- Assign a case manager to patient\n\n# Initiation of 3ʳᵈ Line ART\n\n- Triage\n- Record vital signs and take actions as needed\n- Adherence support\n- Conduct patient education on the new ART regimen: Treatment goals, dosing, drug interactions and potential side effects and adverse events\n- Conduct adherence assessment and counselling\n- Link patient to adherence support systems\n- Clinical assessment\n- Take history and conduct physical examination\n- Complete clinical encounter form and MOH 257 (Green Card)\n- Manage any co-infection and co-morbidities\n- Review for potential drug interactions and contraindications\n- Conduct adherence assessment and review adherence support systems including daily witnessed ingestion plan\n- Reinforce patient education messages on new regimen\n- Currently limited future treatment options\n- Need for perfect adherence (>95%)\n- Dosing schedule and timing\n- Potential side effects and what the patient should do\n- Prescribe new regimen for 2 weeks\n- Confirm dosing as per the weight (for ≤15)\n- Continue other medication e.g., CPT, OI treatment etc.\n- Dispensing\n- Confirm ARV dosing as per the weight (for ≤15)\n- Conduct medication use counselling\n- Dispense 3ʳᵈ Line ARVs for 2 weeks\n- Check for possible drug interaction\n- Community follow up\n- Link all patients to support group, CHV/CHA\n- Plan for home visits as required\n\nAnnex 9 E: cont.\n\n# Patient Follow Up after Treatment Initiation\n\n# Frequency\n\n- First follow-up should be within 2 weeks of initiation of 3rd line ART\n- Subsequent visits should be monthly (or more frequent) until confirmed viral suppression at 6 months\n- Thereafter, follow-up can be 1-3 monthly\n\n# Triage\n\n- Record vital signs and take action as needed\n\n# Adherence Support\n\n- Adherence should be reinforced during every clinic visit, in addition to enhanced adherence counselling sessions\n- Review and address knowledge deficits on new regimen\n- Confirm understanding of adherence, conduct adherence assessment, and reinforce key adherence messages\n- Document reasons for missed doses and manage obstacles to perfect adherence.

How do you manage HIV in pregnancy?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV/Syphilis/Hepatitis B\n\nRoutine antenatal care (ANC) offers an important opportunity to provide high quality combined HIV prevention through targeted health education and counselling; HIV testing for the woman, partners and family members; linkage to HIV prevention and treatment; and to discuss and plan for future conception and contraception needs. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, immune reconstitution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) administered prior to conception.\n* Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case manager and/or mentor mother\n* Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care\n* Pregnancy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.\n* Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregnant women should receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary feeding (Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an |', 'Note that certain patient groups e.g., recent HIV infections, pregnant adolescent girls and young women, women with previous children with HIV infection, patients with high viral load at time of pregnancy confirmation, patients with poor social support systems, patients with history of default from care and those with active co-morbidities etc. may require additional adherence and psychosocial support\n\n# 7.2. Syphilis elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Treatment\n\nThe country has adopted triple elimination of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B among pregnant and breastfeeding women. It is recommended that all pregnant women attending ANC and not aware of their HIV status require a dual HIV syphilis test during their first trimester and a second HIV Syphilis test in the 3ʳᵈ trimester if the initial test was negative.\n\nAll women who test positive for syphilis at any point during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated with the appropriate regimen. (Table 7.3). All babies born of mothers who test positive for syphilis are suspected to be exposed to syphilis and should also be treated with the correct regimen (Table 7.3). Ensure to perform contact tracing for all the sexual contacts and ensure they are treated for syphilis.\n\nSymptoms of congenital syphilis may not become apparent for several weeks or months after birth.\n\n# 7.3. Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).\n\nRefer to Chapter 9 for management of HIV/HBV coinfection.\n\n\n\n# Table 7.3: ARV Prophylaxis for HIV-Exposed Infants\n\n| Infant Scenario    | Infant Prophylaxis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maternal Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| HIV Exposed Infant | * Infant prophylaxis\n\n  * AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP + cotrimoxazole should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding\n  * Infant prophylaxis can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP if the child is not breastfeeding (death of mother or separation with mother)\n  * The infant prophylaxis regimen applies to all infants irrespective of age when identifying HIV exposure (e.g., mother diagnosed HIV-positive in the postpartum period)\n\n* DBS or whole blood for PCR at 6 weeks or first contact, following EID algorithm (Figure 2.1)\n\n* Birth testing (Figure 2.2) may be conducted in sites where point of care has been implemented and when medically indicated | - If mother not on ART, initiate ART as soon as possible (preferably same day)\n- If mother is on ART for ≥ 3 months and the VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, intensify adherence, repeat the VL\n- If VL <50 copies/ml, continue current regimen\n- Follow Viral load algorithm Figure 6.6 |']","To manage HIV in pregnancy:

This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women']","ART should be started in all patients, including infants, as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis.",0.75,0.9203096306842391,6.39,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1.

For adults a normal CD4 count is above 500\n- How are CD4 cells affected by HIV\n- HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells\n- After years of constant attack from HIV, the CD4 count falls\n- What happens when CD4 cells decrease\n- When the CD4 count falls too low (usually below 200), diseases called “opportunistic infections” are able to infect the body because the body cannot defend itself\n- Common opportunistic infections include: tuberculosis, pneumonia, skin problems, white spots in the mouth, and chronic diarrhoea\n- How often is CD4 count measured\n- CD4 count is measured for all patients at the beginning of treatment, to see if you are likely to get any opportunistic infections\n- Once you start treatment for HIV, we do not need to check CD4 count frequently, but we will use\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.', '## 3.5 Follow-up of PLHIV after ART initiation\n\nFollow-up of patients on ART is determined by the duration the patient has been on treatment, how well they understand the treatment and their response to ART. Follow-up includes scheduled clinical appointments, unscheduled clinical assessments for patients with concerns/complaints, routine and as-needed laboratory monitoring.\n\n\n\n## 3.5.1 First 6 months after ART initiation\n\nAfter ART initiation, patients need to be monitored closely for development of adverse drug events, identify and address barriers to adherence, and development of IRIS. A reasonable follow-up schedule for most patients is 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ART initiation (Table 3.5 and 3.6).\n\nWhen possible, follow-up for a particular patient should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 6 months in care.\n\n## 3.5.2 Differentiated Service Delivery for Patients beyond the 1st 6 months of ART\n\nFollow up of patients beyond 6 months of ART is described in table 3.5. It also provides the criteria for determining if a patient is established on ART.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Patients who are not established on ART require closer follow-up.\n- Patients who are established on ART require less frequent facility follow-up, with up to six months between clinical appointments\n\n### Table 3.5: Differentiated Follow-up of Patients Beyond the First 6 Months of ART\n\n| Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Patients with any of the following:- On treatment for < 6 months\n- Any active OIs (including TB) in the previous 6 months\n- Poor or questionable adherence to scheduled clinic visits in the previous 6 months.\n- Most recent VL ≥ 200 copies/ml\n- Children < 2 years |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Package of Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | * Standard Package of Care\n* Case management to address reason/s for not being established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Focus of Counselling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women']",The preferred first-line regimen for adults starting ART for the first time is TDF + 3TC + DTG.,1.0,0.9497378181906878,10.36,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression. Table 7.2 summarizes recommendations for use of ART for HIV positive pregnant women.\n\n### Table 7.2: Summary of Use of ART for HIV Positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women\n\n| Overall recommendations             | Overall recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| When to start                       | ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count and continued lifelong.

If this is not available, viral load specimens and results for pregnant and breastfeeding women should be given priority across the laboratory referral process (including specimen collection, testing and return of results).\n\n* For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n* For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy or breastfeeding, obtain a VL irrespective of when prior VL was done, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n* For pregnant or breastfeeding women with a VL ≥ 50 copies/ml: assess for and address potential reasons for viremia, including intensifying adherence support, repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence, including daily witnessed ingestion, where feasible and appropriate\n\n  * If the repeat VL is 200 - 999 copies/ml consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG\n  * If the repeat VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml, change to an effective regimen. Refer to Table 6.10\n  * If the repeat VL is < 200 copies/ml (LDL) then continue routine |"", '# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population.

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '## 8.4. ART for TB/HIV Co-infection\n\nAs with all PLHIV, those who are diagnosed with TB/HIV co-infection should be on ART and CPT as part of the comprehensive package of care for PLHIV.\n\n### Timing of ART for TB/HIV Co-infection\n\n- Patients who are not yet on ART\n  - Start TB treatment immediately\n  - Initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks\n  - For TB meningitis delay ART for 4 to 8 weeks\n  - Monitor closely for IRIS (Annex 16)\n\n\n\n• Patients who are already on ART\n   o Start TB treatment immediately\n   o Continue ART, assessing for treatment failure and making any required\n     adjustments to the ART regimen based on drug-drug interactions (Table 8.7)\n   o Monitor closely for IRIS (Annex 16)\n• Patient being treated concurrently for TB and HIV require close monitoring for\n  toxicity\n• MDR TB and HIV co-infection should be managed in settings where close toxicity\n  monitoring and follow up by experienced clinicians or multi-disciplinary team is\n  possible\n\nPreferred ART regimens for patients with TB/HIV co-infection are summarized in Tables 8.6 - 8.8.\n\nTable 8.6: Preferred ART Regimens for TB/HIV Co-infection for Patients Newly Initiating 1st\nLine ART ¹\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | 1ˢᵗ Line ART if TB/HIV Co-infection                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | Start anti-TB treatment immediately; start ART after 4 weeks of age, once tolerating anti-TB drugs (follow the regimen recommendations for children ≥ 4 weeks old)                                                      |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | • ABC + 3TC + DTG<br/>• Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily dosing |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | • Give TDF/3TC/DTG FDC morning + DTG 50mg evening for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to TDF/3TC/DTG FDC once daily           |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | • Give TDF/3TC/DTG FDC morning + DTG 50mg evening for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to TDF/3TC/DTG FDC once daily           |\n\n\n¹ Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based ARV dosing\n\n\n\n# Table 8.7: Preferred ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Virally Suppressed on 1st Line ART¹,²\n\n| Current Regimen³ |          | Recommended Substitution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| PI/r-based⁴      | All ages | * Switch from PI/r to DTG and continue this regimen even after completing TB treatment.

All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results;

you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']",Second-line ART is initiated when any drug in the recommended first-line regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated.,0.0,1.0000000000000007,16.78,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

Can HIV be managed with a two-drug regimen?,"['# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', 'The general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co-infected patients initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n## B.

Follow-up/Monitoring\n\nFollow-up of HIV/HBV co-infected patients should be as for all other patients on ART. However, consider more frequent monitoring (using ALT) for patients with active liver disease (jaundice, liver cirrhosis and features of portal hypertension) at baseline. The presence of co-infection also increases the risk of drug-related hepatotoxicity from all classes of ARVs by 3-5 times, especially when anti-TB and ART are given simultaneously. Also, hepatic flare-up (AST > 5 times normal value) can occur, often in the initial 3 months.\n\nNote: ALT elevations 5-10 times normal can be tolerated in the first 3 months of ART as long as the patient is not severely symptomatic, remains stable without progression, and there is no evidence of synthetic dysfunction (INR normal, glucose normal, albumin normal).\n\nPatients with persistently elevated ALT levels during follow-up should be referred to a specialist. Subsequent laboratory monitoring after baseline should be conducted every 6 months. Patients should be counselled and supported to abstain from consuming alcohol.\n\n## D. Stopping treatment, /treatment interruptions\n\nTDF-containing ART should not be stopped in a patient with HIV/HBV co-infection as this may result in a flare-up of the hepatitis. If the regimen must be stopped and another alternative for suppressing hepatitis B cannot be found, liver enzymes should be monitored and treatment re-instated as soon as possible.\n\n\n# 9.2 Hepatitis C/HIV Co-infection\n\nIn Kenya, the prevalence of HCV infection is high in PWID (estimated to be 12-16%). The prevalence in the general population and among PLHIV is low (estimated to be &#x3C; 3%), but likely to be higher in HIV infected PWID due to shared routes of transmission. HIV/ HCV co-infection is associated with\n\n- Rapid progression of liver fibrosis\n- Higher risk of deteriorating liver disease even in the presence of controlled HIV disease\n- Worsened hepatotoxicity as a result of ART and other drugs used in the treatment of comorbidities\n\nThus, HIV-positive persons at risk of HCV co-infection should be identified and offered HCV treatment. The recent introduction of direct acting antiviral therapies (DAAs) for treatment of HCV has simplified the management of HIV/HCV co-infection, making it possible to manage uncomplicated HIV/HCV infection safely even in primary care settings.\n\nHowever, treatment for HCV is a rapidly evolving field of therapeutics. Providers are encouraged to seek regular updates on the subject and, when in doubt, to discuss individual cases with experienced providers.\n\n# 9.2.1 Screening\n\nHCV serology should be offered to individuals at risk of HCV infection. These include\n\n- People who inject or use intranasal drugs\n- Persons who have had tattoos, body piercing or scarification procedures from settings with doubtful infection prevention precautions\n- Children born to HCV positive mothers\n\nUp to 30% of individuals who are infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection. To confirm chronic HCV infection, HCV positive individuals should be offered nucleic acid HCV RNA testing to establish presence of chronic HCV infection.']","The guideline excerpts provided do not explicitly address the use of a two-drug regimen for managing HIV.

Identify strategies to overcome these barriers\n- Repeat VL after 3 months on new regimen\n- If VL undetectable: adherence counselling every 3 months\n- If VL is detectable: discuss as MDT and consult Clinical TWG', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","Regimen switching to 3rd line ART is appropriate when there is confirmation of the prescribed regimen, availability, and a management plan.",1.0,0.9267406316438939,9.1,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

Contact the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) for guidance on urgent collection of DRT samples\n3. Use “super-boosted” LPV/r by adding additional ritonavir to manage the drug interaction between LPV/r and rifampicin (see Annex 10 for dosing recommendations). Two weeks after TB treatment is completed the child should go back to standard LPV/r dosing.', '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women']","Resistance testing plays a crucial role for patients on second-line ART, subsequent regimens, those with drug intolerance, or those using nonstandard drugs who need a regimen change due to TB treatment.",0.0,0.8847080085351239,15.84,llm,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# Annexes\n\n## Annex 13 A: Drug-Drug Interactions - NNRTIs\n\n| Drugs Affected       | Nevirapine (NVP)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Efavirenz (EFV)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ANTIRETROVIRALS      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Dolutegravir         | Co-administration not recommended because NVP decreases levels of DTG                                                                                                                                                                    | Co-administration not recommended because EFV decreases levels of DTG.

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.', '##

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', 'For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI management.\n\n# 8.2.1. Indications for TPT\n\nTPT should be provided to those patients in whom TB is excluded (using the ICF tool) and meet the eligibility criteria to initiate TPT. The following client categories are eligible for TPT who screen negative for active TB:\n\n- All PLHIV above 12 months of age (children, adolescents and adults including pregnant and breastfeeding women)\n- All household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB\n- Prisoners and staff working in prison setting\n- Health care workers and other staff in health care setting\n- Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines\n\nNeonates born to mothers with TB, or exposed to close contacts with TB should be given TPT once TB disease has been ruled out. BCG should be given 2 weeks after completion of TPT or anti-TB treatment.\n\n# Summary of recommendations for TPT among the PLHIV\n\n- PLHIV are at a much higher risk of getting TB disease compared to the general population.\n- TB preventive therapy should be given to all PLHIV above 12 months of age who do not have active TB disease. This should be done irrespective of immune status, ART status, previous history of TB and pregnancy status.\n- Children aged &#x3C;12 months living with HIV who are household contacts of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, and whom active TB has been ruled out should receive TB preventive therapy.\n- TPT may be given immediately following successful completion of TB treatment among the PLHIV.\n- Repeat TPT is not recommended among PLHIV except if a PLHIV becomes a household contact of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB.\n- PLHIV aged 15 years and above should be provided with 3 months of weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid (3HP), while those less than 15 years are given 6 months of daily INH (6H).\n- In PLHIV on PI/r-based ART, pregnant women and those who do not tolerate 3HP should be given six months of daily INH (6H).\n- For eligible patients previously treated for TB, initiate TPT upon completion of their TB treatment.\n\n\n\n## 8.2.2. Contraindications to TPT\n\nPatients with the following should not receive TPT until the underlying issue(s) are addressed:\n\n- Active tuberculosis disease\n- Active hepatitis (acute or chronic)\n- Chronic alcohol abuse\n- Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy\n\n## 8.2.3.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.']","In cases of ART failure, the guidelines recommend not changing regimens until the reasons for treatment failure are identified and addressed urgently using a case-management approach. Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART and confirmed when VL remains ≥ 1000 copies/ml after addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL. Enhanced adherence counseling should be provided to patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure, focusing on understanding viral load concepts, discussing reasons for high VL, and exploring solutions to improve adherence.",1.0,0.9595689177367909,23.6,cosine,gpt-4o

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit. If they desire to become pregnant, pregnancy should be planned i.e., attain viral load suppression, immune reconstitution and have Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) administered prior to conception.\n* Women who are newly diagnosed with HIV and/or newly initiating ART require more intensive adherence counseling and HIV education, which may include a case manager and/or mentor mother\n* Birth preparedness: support the pregnant woman and her partner to develop an individual birth plan that includes place of delivery with skilled attendants, emergency transport, birth companionship and readiness for infant care\n* Pregnancy danger signs: offer information on returning to ANC as soon as possible in case they develop fever, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, swollen feet, convulsions and per vaginal bleeding.\n* Maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN): All pregnant women should receive information on proper nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding, safe infant feeding and optimal nutrition practices. Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status, followed by complementary feeding (Table 7.7). During pregnancy, provide iron, folate and multivitamins; monitor for anemia, advise on adequate caloric intake (HIV positive women require an |', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

Hepatitis B elimination for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nRequires routine testing of pregnant women to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce Mother to Child Transmission of viral hepatitis B.\n\nRegular screening should be done by incorporation of viral hepatitis screening as part of the ANC profile. This is recommended for Hepatitis B &#x26; C which pose a big risk to both the mother and fetus.\n\nFor pregnant and breastfeeding women who are found to be positive for HBsAg, offer appropriate treatment options of ARVs containing TDF/3TC or FTC containing regimens. This treatment also acts as prophylaxis for HBV transmission from mother to child. All pregnant and breastfeeding women without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. (Chapter 9).\n\nHIV positive infants without evidence of infection should be vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Infants born of mothers who test positive for HBsAG should be treated using Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (Table 7.3).\n\nRefer to Chapter 9 for management of HIV/HBV coinfection.\n\n\n\n# Table 7.3: ARV Prophylaxis for HIV-Exposed Infants\n\n| Infant Scenario    | Infant Prophylaxis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maternal Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| HIV Exposed Infant | * Infant prophylaxis\n\n  * AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, NVP + cotrimoxazole should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding\n  * Infant prophylaxis can be discontinued after a minimum of 12 weeks on NVP if the child is not breastfeeding (death of mother or separation with mother)\n  * The infant prophylaxis regimen applies to all infants irrespective of age when identifying HIV exposure (e.g., mother diagnosed HIV-positive in the postpartum period)\n\n* DBS or whole blood for PCR at 6 weeks or first contact, following EID algorithm (Figure 2.1)\n\n* Birth testing (Figure 2.2) may be conducted in sites where point of care has been implemented and when medically indicated | - If mother not on ART, initiate ART as soon as possible (preferably same day)\n- If mother is on ART for ≥ 3 months and the VL is ≥ 50 copies/ml, intensify adherence, repeat the VL\n- If VL <50 copies/ml, continue current regimen\n- Follow Viral load algorithm Figure 6.6 |']","To manage HIV in pregnancy, follow these key steps:

1. **Routine Antenatal Care (ANC):**
   - Integrate HIV prevention and treatment into routine ANC, including testing for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
   - Encourage at least 8 ANC visits for monitoring and addressing health issues.

2. **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT):**
   - Offer interventions to prevent transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
   - Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.

3. **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):**
   - Initiate ART in all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, using TDF/3TC/DTG as the first-line regimen.
   - Monitor viral load during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

4. **Infant Prophylaxis:**
   - Administer AZT+NVP for 6 weeks to HIV-exposed infants, with NVP continued until 6 weeks after breastfeeding cessation.
   - Conduct early infant diagnosis at 6 weeks or first contact.

5. **Special Considerations:**
   - Provide additional support for high-risk groups and adjust ART regimens based on viral load results.

6. **Syphilis and Hepatitis B Management:**
   - Conduct dual testing for HIV and syphilis in the first and third trimesters.
   - Screen for hepatitis B and offer treatment to HBsAg-positive women, with vaccination for those without infection.",1.0,0.9588993683547037,20.06,cosine,gpt-4o
When should infants start ART?,"[""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression. Table 7.2 summarizes recommendations for use of ART for HIV positive pregnant women.\n\n### Table 7.2: Summary of Use of ART for HIV Positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women\n\n| Overall recommendations             | Overall recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| When to start                       | ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count and continued lifelong.

This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']",Infants should start ART as soon as possible after a confirmed HIV diagnosis.,0.5,0.9575481907693416,13.47,cosine,gpt-4o
What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed

Healthcare workers are at increased risk of exposure to HIV through contact with contaminated blood and other body fluids containing HIV through needle stick injuries and injuries by other sharp objects or through non-intact skin and mucous membranes.\n\n## 10.2 Recommended ARVs for PEP\n\nThree-drug regimens are preferred for PEP. However, if the person is unable to tolerate the third drug, (usually the PI/r), two drugs can be used.\n\n### Table 10.1: Recommended ARVs for PEP\n\n| Age        | Weight     | Preferred            | Alternate                                                               |\n| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| <15 years  | < 30kg     | ABC + 3TC + DTG      | ● AZT + 3TC + DTG<br/>● AZT+3TC and LPV/r may be used as the third drug |\n|            | ≥ 30 kg    | TDF + 3TC /FTC + DTG | ● TDF+3TC/FTC and ATV/r may be used as alternative third drug           |\n| ≥ 15 years | Any weight | TDF + 3TC/FTC + DTG  | ● TDF+3TC/FTC and ATV/r may be used as alternative third drug           |\n\n\n\n\n# 10.3 Eligibility For PEP\n\nPEP should always be offered as soon as possible, preferably within 72 hours, after an exposure. Persons who present after 72 hours should be provided with other appropriate services including counselling and support.\n\nEligibility assessment for PEP is based on the type of exposure, HIV status of source where possible and timing of seeking care.\n\nThe following include the eligibility criteria for PEP.\n\n- Exposed individual is HIV negative at baseline.\n- Exposure must have occurred within the past 72 hours.\n- Exposure to bodily fluids pose a significant risk (exposure and/or material):\n- Type of exposure: mucous membrane (i.e. sexual exposure; splashes to eye, nose, or oral cavity), non-intact skin, percutaneous injury or parenteral exposures\n- Material: blood, blood-stained body fluids, breast milk; semen; vaginal secretions; synovial, pleural, pericardial, amniotic fluids; CSF, and HIV cultures in laboratories\n\nExposures that do not require HIV PEP include:\n\n- When the exposed individual is already HIV positive.\n- Exposures to bodily fluids that do not pose a significant risk, i.e., tears, non-blood-stained saliva, urine, and sweat.\n\n# 10.4 Management and Follow Up\n\nPatients should be counselled and encouraged to complete the full course of PEP once a decision has been made to initiate PEP.\n\nFor occupational exposure, immediate care of the exposure site includes washing the site with soap and water and allow the wound to bleed freely for several minutes.\n\nNOTE: Do not do anything that will increase tissue damage such as squeezing, scrubbing, or cutting the site further.']","The recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men is as follows:

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", ""# 6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART initiation are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n## Table 6.1: Special Considerations for Timing of ART Initiation\n\n| Population                                                   | Timing of ART Initiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Additional Notes                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pregnant and breastfeeding women                             | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Intensive adherence counselling, support and close follow-up required because of limited time for patient preparation   |\n| Infants (< 12 months old)                                    | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV.

Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding.

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF.

HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co-infection Prevention and Management\n\n## 9.1 Hepatitis B/HIV Co-infection\n\nHIV and Hepatitis-B Virus (HBV) share infection transmission routes. Acute HBV infection in HIV positive people is associated with increased risk of chronicity, reduced chances of spontaneous clearance, higher rates of replication and reactivation and therefore increased incidence of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, HIV/HBV co-infection has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and poorer HIV treatment outcomes. Other complications of HIV/HBV co-infection include increased incidence of drug-related hepatotoxicity, drug-drug interactions and ART-related immune reconstitution hepatitis.\n\n### 9.1.1 Screening\n\nAll adolescents and adults living with HIV (plus children who did not complete routine childhood immunizations) should be screened for HBV infection, using HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation. To promote population-wide prevention, hepatitis B prevention should be integrated into routine HIV prevention and care programs. In this setting, other indications for HBsAg screening could include\n\n- Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg positive individuals\n- Pregnant women\n- Persons who inject drugs (PWID)\n- Men who have sex with men\n- Sex workers\n- Persons with multiple sexual partners\n- Prisoners\n- Blood donors\n- Unvaccinated healthcare providers\n\nPLHIV on follow-up who present with signs of liver disease (jaundice, ascites, abnormal liver on palpation, other signs of cirrhosis) or unexplained and persistent ALT elevation should also be screened for HBV as part of their work-up.\n\n### 9.1.2 Prevention\n\nA. Vaccination: HBV vaccination reduces the risk of new (incident) HBV infection in PLHIV and also reduces the risk of new infections becoming chronic. Therefore;\n\n- HIV positive infants, children, adolescents and adults without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)\n- HIV exposed infants (HEI) should also receive hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization (Table 4.21)\n\n\n\no Babies and young children (through EPI and catch-up immunization for those who missed EPI vaccination)\no Household contacts of HBsAg positive people\no Sexual contacts of HBsAg positive people\no People on haemodialysis\no PWID\no Individuals with chronic liver disease and/or hepatitis C\no Inmates and prison personnel\no Healthcare workers\n\nTable 9.1: Hepatitis B Vaccination Schedule for HIV-positive Adolescents and Adults\n\n| Vaccine                    | Dose (intramuscular)     | Schedule              |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Non-adjuvanted formulation | Double the standard dose | 0, 1, 2, and 6 months |\n| Adjuvanted formulation     | Standard dose            |                       |\n\n\n*Booster vaccination is not required for persons who have completed the full vaccination schedule\n\nB. General preventive measures: General measures for infection prevention adopted by PLHIV and in healthcare settings are effective in preventing HBV transmission. These include\n\n● Hand hygiene\n● Use of personal protective equipment\n● Medical waste management including safe disposal of used sharps\n● Disinfection and sterilization\n● General health advice against sharing of personal effects like towels, tooth-brushes, razors, combs and other grooming equipment\n● Harm reduction counselling and services for PWID as outlined in Chapter 12\n● Safer sex practices\n\n### 9.1.3 Treatment\n\nA. When to start ART\n\n| All HIV infected patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B should be started on ART irrespective of CD4 cell count, WHO clinical stage or stage of liver disease |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\nThe general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co-infected patients initiating therapy.']","In managing HIV in tuberculosis (TB) co-infection:

- **For Patients Not on ART**: Start TB treatment immediately and initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks. Delay ART for 4 to 8 weeks in cases of TB meningitis.

- **For Patients Already on ART**: Continue ART while starting TB treatment, assess for treatment failure, and adjust ART regimens as needed due to drug-drug interactions.

- **Preferred ART Regimens**: Adjust ART regimens during rifampicin-containing TB treatment, such as switching to dolutegravir (DTG) or efavirenz (EFV) based on the current regimen and patient characteristics.

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

Table 3.2 summarizes the recommended baseline laboratory investigations for all PLHIV. Additional investigations should be based on clinical indication.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review. Aligning']","The lab tests used to monitor ART include:

- **CD4 Cell Count:** Baseline test for all PLHIV, essential for diagnosing Advanced HIV Disease and determining care eligibility.
- **Viral Load (HIV-1 RNA):** Baseline test, important for monitoring treatment efficacy and identifying treatment failure.
- **Serum Cryptococcal Antigen (sCrAg):** For adults and adolescents with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm³.
- **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Baseline and follow-up at weeks 2, 4, and 12 if on AZT.
- **Urinalysis (Protein & Glucose):** Baseline, then annually if on TDF.
- **Creatinine:** Baseline, then annually if on TDF.
- **Glucose:** Baseline, then annually.
- **Plasma Lipid Profile:** Baseline, then annually.
- **HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen):** Baseline test.
- **Syphilis Serology (VDRL, TPHA, or RPR):** Baseline, then annually for those at risk.
- **HCV Antibody:** Baseline for patients with a history of injection drug use.
- **HPV Testing:** For women aged 25-49, at baseline and every two years.
- **Drug Resistance Testing:** Once treatment failure is confirmed on a DTG- or PI-based regimen.",1.0,0.9999999999999994,24.03,cosine,gpt-4o
When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results;

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '- Religious beliefs: find out if the patient has tried faith healing, or if they have ever stopped taking their medicine because of their religious beliefs.\n\nAnnex 9A: Cont.\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Review the patient’s file to determine if they have been referred to other services. This includes referrals to social services, support groups, psychology services, nutrition services, medical clinics, substance abuse groups, etc.\n- Ask the patient if they attended the appointments, check in on their experience with the referral services and re-organize referrals as necessary.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to develop a plan that addresses each of the issues. It is important to let the patient come up with the solutions so that they can own them.\n- Some examples of addressing adherence challenges:\n- - Behavioural barriers: using a reminder tool; using a pill box; redefining the medication schedule to fit with the patient’s daily schedule; keeping an emergency dose of drugs when away from home.\n- Refer to clinician in case of side effects.\n- Socio-economical barriers: move on to disclosure process; identify a treatment buddy; join a support group; refer to CBO/NGO to learn about income generating activities.\n- Emotional barriers: emotional support or refer to clinician for mental health management.\n\nAgree on a follow-up date for the next session.\n\n# Session 2 (usually 2 weeks after Session 1, preferably with the same provider)\n\n# Review Adherence Plan\n\n- Ask the patient if he/she thinks adherence has improved since the last visit. Enquire in a friendly way if any doses have been missed.\n- Review the patient’s barriers to adherence documented during the first session and if strategies identified have been taken up. If not, discuss why.\n\n# Identify Any New Issues\n\n- Discuss specific reasons why the patient may have missed their pills or a clinic appointment since the last counselling session, and determine if it is a new issue that wasn’t addressed during the first session.\n- Discuss if other issues have come up because of implementing the adherence plan (e.g., perhaps the disclosure process had unintended results).\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Follow-up on any referrals made during the previous session.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to modify their original adherence plan to address each of the issues. It is important to let the patient come up with the solutions so that they own them.\n- Give another short motivational speech on how you believe in the patient! You know they can do this!

Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART']","The recommended adherence strategies for HIV/AIDS treatment include:

1. **Adherence Monitoring:**
   - Use standardized questionnaires (e.g., Morisky Medication Adherence Scale) and conduct assessments at every visit or when issues are suspected.
   - Perform pill counts and use pharmacy refill records to track adherence.
   - Monitor viral load according to guidelines.

2. **Home Visits:**
   - Conduct home visits to assess living conditions and medication storage, with patient consent.

3. **Provider-Patient Relationship:**
   - Foster a collaborative, non-judgmental relationship and inquire about adherence openly.

4. **Training and Support:**
   - Train providers in adherence support and refer challenging cases to specialists.

5. **Addressing Barriers:**
   - Identify and address barriers using reminder tools, support groups, and emotional support.

6. **Adherence Plan Development:**
   - Collaborate with patients to create and adjust adherence plans.

7. **Follow-up and Review:**
   - Schedule regular follow-ups to review adherence and ensure continuity of care.

8. **Referrals and Networking:**
   - Follow up on referrals to additional support services as needed.

9. **Adherence Preparation and Support:**
   - Start adherence support at diagnosis and tailor it to the patient's ART stage, with consistent follow-up.",1.0,0.93757242107593,30.67,cosine,gpt-4o

This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## Table 6.11: Possible Third-line ART in Children, Adolescents and Adults\n\n|          | Possible 3ʳᵈ Line Regimen        | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Children | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                | Third line ART selection is based on DRT results<br/><br/>Note that the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG may recommend reusing some of the ARVs the patient has already failed, even when resistance is present |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + ABC (or TDF) + 3TC + DRV/r |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Adults   | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF (or AZT) + 3TC         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n\n\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE', '# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders']","The guidelines indicate that while two-drug regimens are not standard for first-line or second-line ART, they may be considered in specific contexts, such as third-line therapy, particularly in cases involving drug resistance or intolerance.",0.0,0.0,13.85,cosine,gpt-4o

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use.

If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions.

2. **Understanding Treatment Failure:**
   - Explain the consequences of irregular ART use, including increased viral load and drug resistance.

3. **Management of 3rd Line ART:**
   - Confirm the regimen and management plan in a pre-initiation meeting.
   - Provide comprehensive education on the new regimen and reinforce adherence support.

4. **Adherence and Side Effects:**
   - Educate on adherence importance and manage side effects, encouraging consultation for severe reactions.

When is regimen switching appropriate?,"['Adherence support systems will need to be adapted to patients’ specific needs and the context (Table 5.18). Special attention needs to be given to children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients with mental health disorders and substance users.\n\n# 5.6 Treatment Preparation for 2nd Line or 3rd Line ART\n\nAfter confirming treatment failure and making the decision to start 2nd line or 3rd line ART (based on discussion as an MDT, and in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG), the patient requires targeted counselling and education to prepare them for the new regimen and to support ongoing adherence (Figure 5.2).\n\n- Review the patient file\n- Review patient file\n- Confirm all the barriers to adherence have been addressed during Enhanced Adherence Counselling, if not – address remaining barriers before considering changing regimens\n- Assess patient’s knowledge and understanding\n- HIV, viral load and ART\n- The importance of good adherence and potential problems of non-adherence\n- Reasons for switching to 2nd or 3rd line ART: treatment failure with repeated high viral load\n- Provide patient education\n- Strengthen key messages on HIV and viral load\n- Provide information on 2nd/3rd line ART: more complex to take (more pills, twice-a-day dosing), very limited options if this fails\n- Provide simple take-home IEC materials on 2nd or 3rd line ART management\n- Construct adherence plan\n- Confirm patient’s willingness to start new regimen\n- Ensure that the patient understands the treatment plan (drug regimen, dosing schedule, dietary restrictions, potential side effects, what to do when missing doses or experiencing side effects)\n- Prepare for situations that could impair good adherence, and encourage disclosure of poor adherence\n- Plan sessions with the pharmacist on medication adherence, and nutritionist on nutritional aspects\n\nEnsure a monthly follow-up counselling session during clinic visits for the first 6 months after initiating the new regimen\n\n- Ensure monthly counselling follow-up sessions\n- Follow up on problems identified during the previous sessions\n- Assess patient’s adherence and explore any reasons for poor adherence. Identify strategies to overcome these barriers\n- Repeat VL after 3 months on new regimen\n- If VL undetectable: adherence counselling every 3 months\n- If VL is detectable: discuss as MDT and consult Clinical TWG', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART', '# Adherence Challenges in Treatment\n\nAdherence is most difficult during the first few months of treatment: the patient is not yet in the habit of taking their medications every day, they are not familiar with common side-effects, and they have more challenges with disclosure and stigma, all of which can interfere with adherence. Poor adherence within the first few months of therapy is also the most risky period for development of resistance mutations, when the viral load is still high.\n\nFor these reasons, adherence preparation, monitoring and support must be emphasized during the first few months of ART until the patient achieves full virological suppression, after which adherence monitoring and support can continue at lower intensity.\n\n# Patient Preparation and Counselling\n\nPatient preparation and counselling should be a collaborative process between the provider and the patient or caregiver, to enable the patient to initiate and continue lifelong treatment. This is best done when the same adherence counsellor follows an individual patient throughout the preparation, initiation, and early ART period.\n\nART can be initiated concurrently with the first adherence counselling session, even during the enrolment visit, especially for infants and for pregnant women. This may also apply to patients with a good understanding of HIV and ART and strong motivation for immediate ART initiation.\n\n# Multidisciplinary Team Support\n\nEach member of the multidisciplinary team should have the requisite training to provide treatment education and offer appropriate support to address potential barriers to adherence. Treatment preparation and support can be offered at triage, consultation, pharmacy or any other clinic station where confidentiality and privacy are assured and providers are adequately trained. It should also be incorporated into health talks, peer support group activities, and group counselling sessions.\n\nBefore commencement of a counseling session, the counselor should ensure that adequate space is available to conduct the counseling, that confidentiality can be maintained, and that tools such as psychosocial assessment forms, treatment literacy flip charts, PHDP flip charts, and tools to document the counseling sessions are available.\n\n\n\n\n# Operational Guidance: Meaningful Involvement of People Living with HIV\n\nPersons living positively (adolescent and adult peer educators who can share personal experiences when needed) should be engaged to support patient education as indicated in the operational guidance below.\n\nFor best patient outcomes, PLHIV themselves should be engaged to lead facility-based and community-based HIV education and support systems. They are often referred to as “peer educators”, “mentor mothers”, and “lay health workers” in these roles. PLHIV have successfully and significantly contributed to: improving identification of people at risk for HIV or infected with HIV; increasing linkage from testing to treatment; reducing onward transmission of HIV; providing psychosocial support, and improving adherence and retention to care and ART.\n\n# Identifying PLHIV to offer peer-led patient support:\n\n- PLHIV on ART for ≥ 1 year\n- Good adherence and undetectable VL\n- Positive attitude and interest in supporting peers\n\n# Preparing and supporting PLHIV to play a role in patient support systems:\n\n- Must be trained for the role they are expected to provide\n- Must have job aids and IEC material appropriate for their role\n- Must be supervised by healthcare professionals\n\n# Potential roles for PLHIV include:\n\n- Supporting HIV self-testing\n- Providing HIV testing services\n- Acting as peer linkage supporters\n- Leading or contributing to facility-based or community-based support groups\n- Providing individual or group HIV education\n- Providing individual or group adherence counselling\n- Distribution of ART refills for stable patients\n\n# Compensation for PLHIV who contribute to patient support systems:\n\n- Recognition (e.g., ID badges; certificates of service; acknowledgement at community forums)\n- Training opportunities with certification\n- Financial compensation (e.g., salaries; stipends; transportation allowances)\n- Priority consideration for employment opportunities\n\n\n\n# 5.1 Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)\n\nART adherence resulting to durable viral suppression eliminates risk of sexual transmission of HIV and is key to HIV epidemic control. Adoption of the Undetectable equals Untransmittable (U=U) campaign is posed to revolutionize HIV treatment among PLHIV and fortify treatment-for-prevention strategies. Multiple studies have showed that durable viral suppression of &#x3C;50 copies/ml eliminates risk of sexual transmission of HIV. (Table 5.17 Viral load cut-offs)\n\nThe framework of U=U offers a unique opportunity to dismantle HIV stigma and discrimination, emphasizes the critical importance of antiretroviral therapy (ART), daily adherence, and continuous engagement in medical care for PLHIV.\n\n# Definitions:\n\n- Durably Undetectable: 2 consecutive viral load results of &#x3C;50 copies/ml\n- Untransmittable: The finding established by various clinical trials and observational studies, that people who maintain an undetectable viral load have minimal HIV virus in their blood and other body fluids secretions that they have “effectively no risk” of passing HIV to others through sex.']","Regimen switching is appropriate when treatment failure is confirmed, typically indicated by repeated high viral load measurements. Before switching, it is essential to address all barriers to adherence through enhanced counselling and involve a multidisciplinary team in the decision-making process.",1.0,0.9913770863189088,24.76,cosine,gpt-4o
What is the role of resistance testing?,"['# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women', 'Refer to the CXR algorithm for TB diagnosis ⁴ MTB detected Trace – Results from sample with few bacilli (paucibacillary TB).

Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# Annexes\n\n## Annex 13 A: Drug-Drug Interactions - NNRTIs\n\n| Drugs Affected       | Nevirapine (NVP)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Efavirenz (EFV)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ANTIRETROVIRALS      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Dolutegravir         | Co-administration not recommended because NVP decreases levels of DTG                                                                                                                                                                    | Co-administration not recommended because EFV decreases levels of DTG.

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '# Table 11.7 Cont: Summary of PrEP Initial and Follow-up Assessment\n\nDuring every visit\n\n- Assess adherence\n- Reassess risk of HIV infection and offer risk reduction counselling\n- HIV testing should be repeated at month 1 and thereafter, every 3 months (this applies for both daily and Event driven PrEP)\n- Assess for adverse effects\n\n# 11.5 Contra-indications to Oral PrEP (daily or ED PrEP)\n\n- HIV infection or suspected acute HIV infection (i.e., flu-like symptoms in the last 4 weeks in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV)\n- Adolescents &#x3C; 35 kg or age &#x3C; 15 years\n- Impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance of &#x3C;50 ml/min)\n- Unable or unwilling to adhere to prescribed PrEP or follow-up schedule.\n\n# 11.6 Criteria for Discontinuing Oral PrEP\n\nPrEP should be discontinued if ANY of the following criteria are met.\n\n- Positive HIV test during follow up.\n- Change in risk status (no ongoing risk)\n- Renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min\n- Client request to stop.\n- Sustained non-adherence.\n\nDiscontinuing daily oral PrEP: Users discontinuing PrEP due to no ongoing risk or requesting to stop should continue PrEP for at least 7 days after the last potential exposure to HIV. Reasons for discontinuation should be documented in the client’s record.\n\nDiscontinuing event–driven PrEP: Event-driven PrEP can be stopped after two daily doses following the last sexual exposure.\n\n# 11.7 Restarting PrEP\n\nAny client restarting PrEP regardless of the preferred method should be assessed for HIV status and a rapid HIV test conducted:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP: Clients who stop PrEP for more than 7 days and wishes to restart should be assessed for resumption of PrEP similar to the assessment done for an initial (first) visit. Importantly, conduct a HIV test before re-starting PrEP. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV test after 4 weeks; if negative, PrEP can be prescribed if the other criteria are fulfilled. The use of condoms should be recommended during the waiting period.\n- Event driven Oral PrEP: Clients who have stopped PrEP for more than a week and who are restarting ED-PrEP should commence with a double dose (two pills) of PrEP as new initiators. Risk assessment should be conducted. If a high-risk exposure occurred in the previous 7 days (i.e., acute HIV infection is suspected), defer PrEP and obtain repeat HIV\n\n# 11.8 Improving adherence to PrEP\n\nApproaches to improve adherence include:\n\n- Encourage ring users to keep ring in place continuously through the 28-day period from initial insertion\n- Disclosure of PrEP use to a partner or trusted person\n- Use of reminder devices like a cell phone alarm.\n- SMS reminders where available and feasible\n- Exploring and mitigation of other barriers to adherence\n- Peer support\n\n# 11.9 Monitoring Sero-conversion among PrEP users\n\nPrEP substantially reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. The efficacy of PrEP is correlated with adherence. Sero-conversion during use of PrEP should be monitored critically as it is increasing the risk of developing drug resistance if clients continue the use of PrEP while HIV infected.\n\nFactors that lead to HIV seroconversion among PrEP sero-converters include:\n\n- Inconsistency in use of PrEP (non-adherence).\n- Social-behavioral factors e.g., poverty, HIV stigma and relationship status that may affect the ability to use PrEP as prescribed.\n- Possible infections with drug resistant strains\n\n# What should be done upon identification of a PrEP sero-converter?\n\nHIV testing among PrEP should be conducted consistently as per the algorithm. Identification of new HIV positive diagnosis among PrEP users should be followed with:\n\n- Immediate discontinuation of PrEP\n- Counselling of client on positive results\n- Linkage to care and ART (immediate ART initiation).\n- Assessment of barriers to adherence that may affect use of ART.\n- Document sero-conversion in client file, PrEP registers, and monthly reporting as required.', '##

When is cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indicated?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF. ICF refers to TB screening among PLHIV, whereas Active TB case finding (ACF) refers to special efforts made by the NTP or other partners that go beyond passive TB case finding at health facilities, in which communities or population groups that are underserved or at higher risk of TB are actively reached for providing access to care, including screening and testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Intensified Case Finding Screening Questions\n\n<div style=""border: 1px solid green; padding: 10px;"">\n\n- If ""Yes"" to any question, take a detailed history, examine the patient and do sputum examination (sputum smear or GeneXpert)\n\n- If ""No"" to questions 1-5 above, consider TPT eligibility and work up for TB Preventive Therapy and repeat screening on subsequent visits\n\n- Questions 5 and 6 do not apply to adults\n\n</div>\n\nThe following are the intensified case finding screening questions:\n\n- Cough of any duration (Y/N)\n- Fever (Y/N)\n- Noticeable weight loss/ Failure to thrive/ Poor weight gain (Y/N)\n- Night sweats (Y/N)\n- Reduced playfulness/ Lethargy/ Irritability (Y/N)\n- Contact with a TB case (Y/N)', '- Follow up smears should be done for all bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases at end of month 2, 5 and 6 of TB treatment using smear microscopy\n\n- Follow up of RR TB and DR TB should be done as per PMDT guidelines\n\n- Patients taking isoniazid containing regimen should also be given Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) daily for the duration of treatment to reduce the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (see Annex 10 for pyridoxine dosing)\n\nOnce TB treatment is started it should be completed; unless another definitive diagnosis (like lung cancer) is established and TB is ruled out.\n\n\n\nTB-LAM is a rapid point-of-care urine dip-stick test that can be performed at the bedside. LAM stands for lipoarabinomannan, which can be detected in urine when it sheds off of the TB cell wall.\n\nGeneXpert is the recommended initial diagnostic test for people with presumptive TB.\n\nTB-LAM SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative test to GeneXpert, but can be performed to help diagnose TB while waiting for GeneXpert test results. TB-LAM cannot detect resistance to rifampicin.\n\nIndications for use of TB-LAM, as an adjunct test to GeneXpert:\n\n- PLHIV with advanced disease (WHO stage 3 or 4 or CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm³ (or ≤ 25% for children ≤ 5 years old)) with presumed TB\n- PLHIV that have any danger signs of severe illness: respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, temperature >39°C, heart rate >120 beats per minute, unable to walk unaided\n- Currently admitted to hospital\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Indications for use of TB-LAM] --> B[LF-LAM Negative]\n    A --> C[LF-LAM Positive]\n    \n    B --> D[TB is not ruled out]\n    D --> |Evaluate the clinical response after 3-5 days of antibiotic treatment, while awaiting GeneXpert results| E[Clinical improvement]\n    D --> |Evaluate the clinical response after 3-5 days of antibiotic treatment, while awaiting GeneXpert results| F[Clinical worsening or no improvement]\n    \n    C --> G[TB is likely]\n    G --> |Initiate TB treatment| H[TB treatment]\n    G --> |Conduct additional investigations for TB and other HIV related diseases as appropriate| I[Additional investigations]\n    G --> |Continue TB treatment even if GeneXpert results come back negative| J[Continue treatment]\n    \n    E --> K[TB is unlikely]\n    K --> |Conduct additional investigations for TB and other opportunistic illnesses| L[Additional investigations]\n    K --> |Complete the course of parenteral antibiotics| M[Complete antibiotics]\n    K --> |Note: If GeneXpert results are positive for TB, initiate TB treatment irrespective of TB-LAM results or clinical improvement| N[Initiate TB treatment if GeneXpert positive]\n    K --> |Note: If GeneXpert results are negative for TB, consider TPT| O[Consider TPT if GeneXpert negative]\n    \n    F --> P[TB is likely]\n    P --> |Start TB treatment if patient is seriously ill or if GeneXpert results come back positive (irrespective of TB-LAM results)| Q[Start TB treatment]\n    P --> |Conduct additional investigations for TB and other HIV-related diseases| R[Additional investigations]\n    P --> |Complete the course of parenteral antibiotics| S[Complete antibiotics]\n```\n\nFigure 8.2: Use of TB-LAM for Diagnosis of TB among PLHIV\n\n# 8.2. TB Preventive Therapy (TPT)\n\nThis section summarizes the current national recommendations for treatment of latent TB infections (LTBI) in the PLHIV population. These are in line with the updated World Health Organization guidelines which include the use of shorter, safer LTBI treatment options for an expanded at-risk population. For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI management.\n\n# 8.2.1. Indications for TPT\n\nTPT should be provided to those patients in whom TB is excluded (using the ICF tool) and meet the eligibility criteria to initiate TPT. The following client categories are eligible for TPT who screen negative for active TB:\n\n- All PLHIV above 12 months of age (children, adolescents and adults including pregnant and breastfeeding women)\n- All household contacts of persons with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB\n- Prisoners and staff working in prison setting\n- Health care workers and other staff in health care setting\n- Other clinical risk groups as defined in LTBI guidelines\n\nNeonates born to mothers with TB, or exposed to close contacts with TB should be given TPT once TB disease has been ruled out.', 'For further guidance, refer to the national guidelines on LTBI management.\n\n# 8.2.1.

This should be done irrespective of immune status, ART status, previous history of TB and pregnancy status.\n- Children aged &#x3C;12 months living with HIV who are household contacts of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, and whom active TB has been ruled out should receive TB preventive therapy.\n- TPT may be given immediately following successful completion of TB treatment among the PLHIV.\n- Repeat TPT is not recommended among PLHIV except if a PLHIV becomes a household contact of a person with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB.\n- PLHIV aged 15 years and above should be provided with 3 months of weekly Rifapentine and Isoniazid (3HP), while those less than 15 years are given 6 months of daily INH (6H).\n- In PLHIV on PI/r-based ART, pregnant women and those who do not tolerate 3HP should be given six months of daily INH (6H).\n- For eligible patients previously treated for TB, initiate TPT upon completion of their TB treatment.\n\n\n\n## 8.2.2. Contraindications to TPT\n\nPatients with the following should not receive TPT until the underlying issue(s) are addressed:\n\n- Active tuberculosis disease\n- Active hepatitis (acute or chronic)\n- Chronic alcohol abuse\n- Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy\n\n## 8.2.3.

What are the guidelines for ART failure?,"['# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.', '# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.']","In patients failing ART, regimens should not be changed until the reasons for treatment failure have been identified and addressed urgently using a case-management approach. Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of ART use, and is confirmed after assessing and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high viral load.",1.0,0.8828938414261485,7.4,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
How do you manage HIV in pregnancy?,"['# 7. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV/Syphilis/Hepatitis B\n\nRoutine antenatal care (ANC) offers an important opportunity to provide high quality combined HIV prevention through targeted health education and counselling; HIV testing for the woman, partners and family members; linkage to HIV prevention and treatment; and to discuss and plan for future conception and contraception needs. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/Syphilis/Hepatitis B should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions (Table 7.1).\n\n## Table 7.1: Essential Package of Antenatal Care\n\n| Intervention                 | Recommendation/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Group & Individual Education | Include information on importance of at least 8 ANC visits, details of ANC services (including health checks and treatment of any illness, medical tests including HIV, syphilis testing and hepatitis B, monitoring of maternal and fetal wellbeing, etc.), nutrition, personal care, recognizing and responding to danger signs during pregnancy, birth preparedness including skilled birth attendance, post-natal care including immunization, family planning and maternal and infant nutrition, HIV prevention and treatment (HTS, preventing new infections during pregnancy including PrEP where appropriate, ART for those who are HIV positive, monitoring of ART and ARV prophylaxis and follow-up for HEIs) and triple elimination (preventing HIV/ syphilis/hepatitis B transmission from mother to child).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Counselling                  | * Pre-conception – Women in reproductive age who are known to be HIV positive should have pregnancy intention assessment visit at every visit.

1. Initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestation, clinical stage, or CD4 count, and continue it lifelong. The recommended first-line ART regimen is TDF/3TC/DTG.

2. Conduct viral load monitoring during pregnancy and breastfeeding, with testing every 3 months for newly initiated women and every 6 months for those already on ART.

3. Provide infant prophylaxis with AZT+NVP for 6 weeks, and continue NVP until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

4. Offer additional adherence and psychosocial support for pregnant adolescent girls, women with high viral load, and those with poor social support systems.",1.0,0.9467711034185822,10.62,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
When should infants start ART?,"[""# 6. Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival. Special considerations for timing of ART initiation are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n## Table 6.1: Special Considerations for Timing of ART Initiation\n\n| Population                                                   | Timing of ART Initiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Additional Notes                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pregnant and breastfeeding women                             | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Intensive adherence counselling, support and close follow-up required because of limited time for patient preparation   |\n| Infants (< 12 months old)                                    | Support ART initiation on the same day as testing positive for HIV.

Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1.

See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4.

DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# 1.4 Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\n- The adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence and the stage of ART initiation and follow-up.\n- All patients with durable viral suppression (2 consecutive viral load results with &#x3C;50 copies) should be offered messaging on Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U).\n- Whenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 3 months in care.\n- For all children/adolescents, the level of disclosure should be assessed at the first visit. Ongoing care should include a plan for age-appropriate disclosure.\n- All patients are at risk of new or worsening barriers to adherence, so adherence monitoring, counselling and support should continue despite viral suppression.\n- Every service delivery point that is providing ARVs for patients (whether ART, PEP, or PrEP) must have a functional system for identifying patients who miss appointments and for taking action within 24 hours of a missed appointment.\n- In patients failing ART, do not change regimens until the reason/s for treatment failure have been identified and addressed (which should be done urgently using a case-management approach).\n\n# 1.5 Antiretroviral Therapy for Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n- The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient’s VL to undetectable levels (Viral Load &#x3C;50 copies/LDL).\n- All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count/%, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria, provided that the individual is willing and ready to start ART.\n- ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, even on the same day as confirming their HIV diagnosis (and preferably within 2 weeks).\n- Preferred first-line ART for infants, children, adolescents and adults:\n- Birth to 4 weeks: AZT + 3TC + NVP\n- > 4 weeks to &#x3C; 15 years old:\n- &#x3C; 30 kg: ABC + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 30 kg: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- ≥ 15 years old: TDF + 3TC + DTG\n- Children and adolescents who are virally suppressed but are NOT on the preferred first-line ART regimen should be assessed for transition and transitioned to the preferred regimen.\n- Treatment failure is suspected when a patient has a VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 3 months of using ART. Treatment failure is only confirmed when VL is ≥ 1,000 copies/ml after assessing for and addressing poor adherence or other reasons for high VL, and then.']","Infants should start ART on the same day as testing positive for HIV, following a first positive PCR test.",0.5,0.9565550213298946,6.39,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
What is the recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2.

ARVs for Post-exposure Prophylaxis\n\nAn ARV regimen, with preferably three-drugs, should be offered as post exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible (preferably within 72 hours) after an exposure.\n\n## 10.1 What is PEP?\n\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is short-term use of antiretroviral treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure.\n\nPeople can be accidentally exposed to HIV through healthcare work or due to exposures outside healthcare setting, for example, through unprotected sex or sexual assault among adults and children. Healthcare workers are at increased risk of exposure to HIV through contact with contaminated blood and other body fluids containing HIV through needle stick injuries and injuries by other sharp objects or through non-intact skin and mucous membranes.\n\n## 10.2 Recommended ARVs for PEP\n\nThree-drug regimens are preferred for PEP. However, if the person is unable to tolerate the third drug, (usually the PI/r), two drugs can be used.\n\n### Table 10.1: Recommended ARVs for PEP\n\n| Age        | Weight     | Preferred            | Alternate                                                               |\n| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| <15 years  | < 30kg     | ABC + 3TC + DTG      | ● AZT + 3TC + DTG<br/>● AZT+3TC and LPV/r may be used as the third drug |\n|            | ≥ 30 kg    | TDF + 3TC /FTC + DTG | ● TDF+3TC/FTC and ATV/r may be used as alternative third drug           |\n| ≥ 15 years | Any weight | TDF + 3TC/FTC + DTG  | ● TDF+3TC/FTC and ATV/r may be used as alternative third drug           |\n\n\n\n\n# 10.3 Eligibility For PEP\n\nPEP should always be offered as soon as possible, preferably within 72 hours, after an exposure. Persons who present after 72 hours should be provided with other appropriate services including counselling and support.\n\nEligibility assessment for PEP is based on the type of exposure, HIV status of source where possible and timing of seeking care.\n\nThe following include the eligibility criteria for PEP.\n\n- Exposed individual is HIV negative at baseline.\n- Exposure must have occurred within the past 72 hours.\n- Exposure to bodily fluids pose a significant risk (exposure and/or material):\n- Type of exposure: mucous membrane (i.e. sexual exposure; splashes to eye, nose, or oral cavity), non-intact skin, percutaneous injury or parenteral exposures\n- Material: blood, blood-stained body fluids, breast milk; semen; vaginal secretions; synovial, pleural, pericardial, amniotic fluids; CSF, and HIV cultures in laboratories\n\nExposures that do not require HIV PEP include:\n\n- When the exposed individual is already HIV positive.\n- Exposures to bodily fluids that do not pose a significant risk, i.e., tears, non-blood-stained saliva, urine, and sweat.\n\n# 10.4 Management and Follow Up\n\nPatients should be counselled and encouraged to complete the full course of PEP once a decision has been made to initiate PEP.\n\nFor occupational exposure, immediate care of the exposure site includes washing the site with soap and water and allow the wound to bleed freely for several minutes.\n\nNOTE: Do not do anything that will increase tissue damage such as squeezing, scrubbing, or cutting the site further.']","The recommended PrEP regimen for men who have sex with men is Tenofovir 300mg/Emtricitabine 200mg (TDF/FTC) given as one fixed dose combination tablet orally daily.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review. Aligning', '## 3.5 Follow-up of PLHIV after ART initiation\n\nFollow-up of patients on ART is determined by the duration the patient has been on treatment, how well they understand the treatment and their response to ART. Follow-up includes scheduled clinical appointments, unscheduled clinical assessments for patients with concerns/complaints, routine and as-needed laboratory monitoring.\n\n\n\n## 3.5.1 First 6 months after ART initiation\n\nAfter ART initiation, patients need to be monitored closely for development of adverse drug events, identify and address barriers to adherence, and development of IRIS. A reasonable follow-up schedule for most patients is 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ART initiation (Table 3.5 and 3.6).\n\nWhen possible, follow-up for a particular patient should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at every visit. This is particularly important during the first 6 months in care.\n\n## 3.5.2 Differentiated Service Delivery for Patients beyond the 1st 6 months of ART\n\nFollow up of patients beyond 6 months of ART is described in table 3.5. It also provides the criteria for determining if a patient is established on ART.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Patients who are not established on ART require closer follow-up.\n- Patients who are established on ART require less frequent facility follow-up, with up to six months between clinical appointments\n\n### Table 3.5: Differentiated Follow-up of Patients Beyond the First 6 Months of ART\n\n| Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Patients NOT established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Patients with any of the following:- On treatment for < 6 months\n- Any active OIs (including TB) in the previous 6 months\n- Poor or questionable adherence to scheduled clinic visits in the previous 6 months.\n- Most recent VL ≥ 200 copies/ml\n- Children < 2 years |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Package of Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | * Standard Package of Care\n* Case management to address reason/s for not being established on ART                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Focus of Counselling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -

What is the preferred first-line regimen for adults?,"[""# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## 6.3 First-Line ART for Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults (including Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women)\n\nThe recommendations below apply to patients who are starting ART for the first time. Preferred and alternative first line regimens are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. ARVs for infant prophylaxis are presented in the PMTCT chapter in Tables 7.3 to 7.6.\n\n**All patients must have their weight documented at every visit. Children and adolescents less than 15 years must have correct weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit.**\n\nInfants and children depend on their caregivers for adherence to medication. Caregivers should be adequately prepared for their role of administering ARVs to infants and children, including addressing anticipated challenges such as drug palatability. It can be helpful for more than one caregiver to be informed about a child's HIV status and receive instruction on administration of ART.\n\n**Caregivers should always be shown and then asked to demonstrate how to measure and administer ARVs. This should be done both at the time of prescribing the ART (by the clinician) and at the time of dispensing the ART. Clinicians should ensure that the caregiver accompanying a child for clinical review is the same caregiver responsible for day-to-day ART administration.**\n\n### Table 6.2: Preferred First-line ART Regimens and Dosing for Children, Adolescents and Adults<sup>1</sup>\n\n| Age                     | Weight  | Preferred Regimen  | Dosing (correct weight-based dosing must be confirmed at every visit) |\n| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Birth to 4 weeks        | Any     | AZT + 3TC + NVP3   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n| > 4 weeks to < 15 years | < 30 kg | ABC + 3TC + DTG4   | Refer to Annex 10 for weight-based dosing                             |\n|                         | ≥ 30 kg | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n| ≥ 15 years              | Any     | TDF + 3TC + DTG5,6 | TDF/3TC/DTG (300/300/50mg): 1 tab once daily                          |\n\n\n1. Patients currently on first-line regimens that are not included in the indicated preferred (Table 6.2) or alternative (Table 6.3) regimens should be considered for regimen optimization as per Section 6.5.1\n2. See Annex 10 for weight-based dosing of all single-drug and fixed-dose combination formulations\n3. Infants who initiate ART at less than 4 weeks of age should initiate on AZT+3TC+NVP irrespective of previous ART exposure; metabolism of other ARVs is not well known for this age group. As soon as these infants become 4 weeks old, they should switch to ABC/3TC+DTG (dosing included in Annex 10). Consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000, ulizanascop@gmail.com) in case of pre-term infants\n4. Once adolescents reach 30 kg, if virally suppressed they should be considered for transition as per Figure 6.2\n5. TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n6. DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available"", '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n## Table 6.11: Possible Third-line ART in Children, Adolescents and Adults\n\n|          | Possible 3ʳᵈ Line Regimen        | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Children | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                | Third line ART selection is based on DRT results<br/><br/>Note that the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG may recommend reusing some of the ARVs the patient has already failed, even when resistance is present |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + ABC (or TDF) + 3TC + DRV/r |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Adults   | DTG + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + AZT + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF + 3TC + DRV/r          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | DTG + TDF (or AZT) + 3TC         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          | ETV + 3TC + DRV/r                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n\n\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE', '# Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\n> Non-adherence is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. As per the viral load\nmonitoring algorithm, adherence issues must be addressed BEFORE confirming\ntreatment failure.\n\nDaily witnessed ingestion by a treatment buddy or healthcare worker is recommended to confirm\nexcellent adherence before repeating the VL. All adherence issues must be resolved before\nswitching to a new regimen otherwise the patient will quickly fail the new regimen as well, and\nsoon run out of viable ART options. An exception to this may be when the regimen itself is\nthe primary cause of poor adherence (e.g., side effects from one of the ARVs are not\nmanageable such as severe diarrhea with LPV/r that does not improve with symptom\nmanagement), in which case the regimen may need to be modified to allow for perfect adherence.\nThis should be done in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed guidance on adherence preparation, assessment, and support.\n\n## Table 6.10: Recommended Second-line ART Regimens in Infants, Children, Adolescents and Adults, excluding TB/HIV co-infection ¹\n\n| Weight/scenario                  | First-line ART                                                                                      | Second-line ART                                                                                                          |\n| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| < 30 kg                          | ABC (or AZT) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | DRT-based second-line²,³                                                                                                 |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to AZT + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + LPV/r                                                                                   | Take sample for DRT and change to ABC + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | ABC + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | AZT + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | ABC + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| ≥ 30 kg or ≥ 15 years old        | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG (or PI/r)                                                                  | DRT-based second-line²                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| Pregnant and Breastfeeding women | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + DTG                                                                            | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + ATV/r while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + PI/r                                                                           | Take sample for DRT and change to TDF + 3TC + DTG while awaiting DRT results; modify based on DRT results if indicated   |\n|                                  | TDF (or ABC) + 3TC + EFV                                                                            | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | AZT + 3TC + EFV                                                                                     | TDF + 3TC + DTG                                                                                                          |\n| HIV/HBV Co-infection             | Always maintain TDF in order to treat the HBV as well as HIV                                        |                                                                                                                          |\n| TB/HIV Co-infection              | Refer to Table 8.8: Recommended ART Regimens for Patients who Develop TB while Failing 1ˢᵗ Line ART |                                                                                                                          |']",The preferred first-line ART regimen for adults is TDF + 3TC + DTG.,1.0,0.9552458059747022,6.53,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
Can pregnant women use dolutegravir?,"['# Table 6.4 Cont.\n\n# Pregnancy Safety of DTG\n\n- DTG is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.', '# 6.4 Dosing and Administration of Dolutegravir (DTG)\n\nDTG is preferred in first line ART (in combination with other ARVs) for children, adolescents and adults. DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', ""## 7.1 Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-positive Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women and Infant Prophylaxis\n\nThe goal of ART for HIV positive pregnant women is two-fold: to restore and maintain the mother's immune function and therefore general health, and secondly, to prevent transmission of HIV in utero, at labour and delivery and during breastfeeding. To achieve this goal, the mother must take effective antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression.

How should HIV be managed in tuberculosis coinfection?,"['# 8. TB/HIV Co-infection, Prevention and Management\n\nTB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. Reducing this burden of illness requires identifying TB early, providing pre-emptive and preventive treatment for TB, and providing optimal treatment for both HIV and TB. Timely initiation of ART in combination with TB Preventive Therapy are effective ways to reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.\n\nAll PLHIV should receive counselling about the risk of acquiring TB, strategies for reducing exposure to TB, recognizing clinical manifestations of TB and seeking care promptly, the risk of transmission of TB to others and TB preventive therapy to prevent TB disease.\n\nHealthcare settings present suitable conditions for transmission of TB, particularly among vulnerable individuals like PLHIV. All healthcare settings should develop and implement TB infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of TB between patients, visitors and staff.\n\n# 8.1 TB Screening for PLHIV: Intensified Case Finding (ICF)\n\nTB screening and prevention services should be offered at every clinical visit. Symptom-based TB screening using the ICF tool MUST be performed at every clinic visit to rule out active TB; patients who screen positive (presumptive TB cases) must complete definitive diagnostic pathways (Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1) and patients who screen negative should be evaluated for TB preventive therapy (TPT).\n\nActive Case Finding (ACF) differs from ICF.

HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV Co-infection Prevention and Management\n\n## 9.1 Hepatitis B/HIV Co-infection\n\nHIV and Hepatitis-B Virus (HBV) share infection transmission routes. Acute HBV infection in HIV positive people is associated with increased risk of chronicity, reduced chances of spontaneous clearance, higher rates of replication and reactivation and therefore increased incidence of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, HIV/HBV co-infection has been associated with rapid HIV disease progression and poorer HIV treatment outcomes. Other complications of HIV/HBV co-infection include increased incidence of drug-related hepatotoxicity, drug-drug interactions and ART-related immune reconstitution hepatitis.\n\n### 9.1.1 Screening\n\nAll adolescents and adults living with HIV (plus children who did not complete routine childhood immunizations) should be screened for HBV infection, using HBsAg, as part of initial evaluation. To promote population-wide prevention, hepatitis B prevention should be integrated into routine HIV prevention and care programs. In this setting, other indications for HBsAg screening could include\n\n- Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg positive individuals\n- Pregnant women\n- Persons who inject drugs (PWID)\n- Men who have sex with men\n- Sex workers\n- Persons with multiple sexual partners\n- Prisoners\n- Blood donors\n- Unvaccinated healthcare providers\n\nPLHIV on follow-up who present with signs of liver disease (jaundice, ascites, abnormal liver on palpation, other signs of cirrhosis) or unexplained and persistent ALT elevation should also be screened for HBV as part of their work-up.\n\n### 9.1.2 Prevention\n\nA. Vaccination: HBV vaccination reduces the risk of new (incident) HBV infection in PLHIV and also reduces the risk of new infections becoming chronic. Therefore;\n\n- HIV positive infants, children, adolescents and adults without evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg negative) should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Table 9.1)\n- HIV exposed infants (HEI) should also receive hepatitis B vaccination as part of childhood immunization (Table 4.21)\n\n\n\no Babies and young children (through EPI and catch-up immunization for those who missed EPI vaccination)\no Household contacts of HBsAg positive people\no Sexual contacts of HBsAg positive people\no People on haemodialysis\no PWID\no Individuals with chronic liver disease and/or hepatitis C\no Inmates and prison personnel\no Healthcare workers\n\nTable 9.1: Hepatitis B Vaccination Schedule for HIV-positive Adolescents and Adults\n\n| Vaccine                    | Dose (intramuscular)     | Schedule              |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Non-adjuvanted formulation | Double the standard dose | 0, 1, 2, and 6 months |\n| Adjuvanted formulation     | Standard dose            |                       |\n\n\n*Booster vaccination is not required for persons who have completed the full vaccination schedule\n\nB. General preventive measures: General measures for infection prevention adopted by PLHIV and in healthcare settings are effective in preventing HBV transmission. These include\n\n● Hand hygiene\n● Use of personal protective equipment\n● Medical waste management including safe disposal of used sharps\n● Disinfection and sterilization\n● General health advice against sharing of personal effects like towels, tooth-brushes, razors, combs and other grooming equipment\n● Harm reduction counselling and services for PWID as outlined in Chapter 12\n● Safer sex practices\n\n### 9.1.3 Treatment\n\nA. When to start ART\n\n| All HIV infected patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B should be started on ART irrespective of CD4 cell count, WHO clinical stage or stage of liver disease |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\nThe general recommendations for treatment preparation, adherence counselling and support and monitoring of therapy for PLHIV apply. However, because HBV positive patients are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, closer monitoring of liver function (with ALT) is advised. Table 9.2 provides a summary of areas of focus during initial evaluation for HIV/HBV co-infected patients initiating therapy.']","Patients with TB/HIV co-infection should start TB treatment immediately and initiate ART as soon as anti-TB medications are tolerated, preferably within 2 weeks.

If a facility does not have on-site capacity to carry out any test, arrangements should be made to transport specimens to a local or regional reference laboratory.\n\n# 3.4 Management of Patients Who Present with Advanced HIV Disease\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines AHD for adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO clinical stage III or IV disease. All children younger than five years living with HIV who are not already receiving ART and not clinically stable are considered to have AHD.\n\nAdvanced HIV Disease can occur in various settings including PLHIV newly presenting to care, those returning to care after treatment interruption and those on ART who have experienced treatment failure.\n\nPLHIV with AHD have immune suppression with reduced ability to fight opportunistic infections (OI), other infectious and non-infectious diseases, and are therefore at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AHD is also associated with increased health-care costs, use of more health-care services and more frequent monitoring needs. Leading causes of mortality among adults with AHD include immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal disease, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia amongst others.\n\n# CD4 testing criteria to diagnose AHD and determine eligibility for package for care:\n\n- New clients initiating ART:\n- CD4 testing should be conducted as a baseline test for ALL PLHIV\n- Patients who are treatment experienced:\n- PLHIV ≥5 years of age and who had previously initiated ART and are reinitiating after >3 months.\n- Individuals who have documented persistent unsuppressed viral load (two viral load VL >1,000 within 3-6 months).\n\n# Package of Care for AHD\n\nAll PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\nTable 3.3 provides a summary of definitions of well versus advanced disease and package of care for each at enrolment.', '# Table 3.1 Cont.\n\n# Sexual and reproductive history\n\n- History of STIs\n- Current symptoms of STIs\n- Sexual practices\n- Determine HIV status and disclosure to sexual partner(s)\n- ART status of sexual partner/s\n- Pregnancy history and age of all living children\n- Menstrual history, family planning and plans for pregnancy\n- History of cervical cancer screening\n- Vaccination history (including COVID-19 vaccine)\n\nDiscuss:\n\n- Secondary prevention and avoidance of re-infection with STIs\n- Pregnancy intention and contraception needs\n\nEncourage contact tracing and HIV testing for sexual partners and all children &#x3C; 15 years of age of HIV-infected women or whose mothers’ HIV status is unknown\n\n# Vital signs, and anthropometric measurements\n\n- Measure and record weight, height, MUAC (in children and pregnant women), temperature, pulse rate, BP, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry\n- Calculate BMI as: Weight (kg)/ Height²(m); Use z-scores for children\n- Monitor growth trends for children\n\n# General examination\n\nExamine the following:\n\n- Conjunctiva and palms for pallor or jaundice; swollen lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal); mouth for Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) lesions, oral hairy leucoplakia, candidiasis, tooth decay; skin (for drug eruptions, herpes zoster, dermatitis, pruritic papular eruptions (PPE), folliculitis, fungal infections, molluscum, and KS)\n- Assess developmental milestones for children\n\n# Systemic examination\n\n- Central Nervous System\n- Mental State Examination (for mental status)\n- Abdomen\n- Respiratory\n- Cardiovascular\n- Genitourinary/ anorectal system (for ulcers, discharge, condylomata/warts, prostate examination for men ≥ 45 years of age).

Table 3.2 summarizes the recommended baseline laboratory investigations for all PLHIV. Additional investigations should be based on clinical indication. ART should not be delayed if a laboratory test is not available.\n\nTable 3.2: Baseline Laboratory Investigations for PLHIV\n\n| HIV Specific | Test                                            | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|              | • Confirm and document positive HIV test result | • Positive status should be reconfirmed prior to ART initiation for all patients<br/>• Refer to current HIV testing algorithm                                                                                                                                                          |\n|              | CD4 cell count                                  | • For all patients (CD4% for children ≤ 5 years old)<br/>• If CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm3 in PLHIV >5 years, then laboratories should automatically perform a serum cryptococcal antigen (sCrAg) on the same sample to screen for cryptococcal infection<br/>• TB-LAM should also be conducted |\n|              | Viral load (HIV-1 RNA)                          | • Baseline viral load (VL) is recommended for infants after 1st PCR test is positive.

Recommended investigation should not delay ART initiation.\n2. This is the recommended appointment schedule. Clinicians and patients should be encouraged to schedule additional appointments as needed. Patients should be encouraged to return to the HIV clinic for unscheduled appointments whenever an acute issue arises, instead of seeking care at another facility. Early after initiation of ART, and after any regimen modification, every appointment should include:\n- Continued adherence counselling and support (started at the initial visit)\n- Assessment of adherence and correct storage of medication\n- Assessment for and management of early side effects of the drugs, and patient counselling on the same\n3. Patients who are adherent and virally suppressed at month 3, may not need subsequent monthly appointments until month 6.\n4. All PLHIV qualify for ART and should be initiated as soon as possible including same day and within 2 weeks. For patients who do not start ART on the same day as enrolment into HIV care, they should be followed up every week until ART initiation to address whatever issues are delaying ART initiation, for ongoing management of acute medical issues and for treatment preparation and ART readiness assessment.\n5. Refer to table 3.1 for detailed history and physical examinations.\n6. In children and adolescents, weight and height should be measured and recorded at every visit, with weight-based dosing of ARVs confirmed at every visit. In adults, weight and height should be measured at the initial visit to determine nutritional status and calculate the BMI, and thereafter, weight should be measured at every visit.\n7. The first 2-4 visits are critical for assessing and supporting adherence to ART, managing adverse drug reactions, and treating any acute illnesses including IRIS. Adherence should be assessed at every contact with the clinic. See Chapter 5 for specific adherence preparation, monitoring and support procedures for each visit.\n\nRequired laboratory tests are highly recommended for patient monitoring, but are not a pre-requisite for ART initiation. Targeted laboratory tests may be necessary to identify and manage inter-current diseases or adverse drug reactions.\n\n# 3.7 Differentiated Care for Children, Adolescents and Pregnant/breastfeeding Women\n\nChildren, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and key populations face unique challenges in retention and viral suppression and hence may benefit more from differentiated service delivery models adapted to their needs.\n\nChildren: Children’s care is dependent on family and caregiver dynamics. Family-centered approaches to care where clinic visits for parents/caregivers and the child are synchronized, should be used. Assessment and categorization to determine establishment on ART should be conducted for pairs and follow-up tailored to their situations. Weight-based dose adjustments should be incorporated in both the facility and community models (e.g., by using portable weighing scales if out of the health facility) to determine optimal doses for ARVs at each review.

When is second-line ART initiated?,"['# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders', '# Annex 9 E: Management Protocol for Patients Switching to 3rd Line ART\n\n# Management Protocol for patients switching to 3ʳᵈ line ART\n\n# Pre – Initiation MDT Meeting\n\n- Confirm what 3ʳᵈ line ARV regimen is prescribed, its availability and the management plan\n- Assign a case manager to patient\n\n# Initiation of 3ʳᵈ Line ART\n\n- Triage\n- Record vital signs and take actions as needed\n- Adherence support\n- Conduct patient education on the new ART regimen: Treatment goals, dosing, drug interactions and potential side effects and adverse events\n- Conduct adherence assessment and counselling\n- Link patient to adherence support systems\n- Clinical assessment\n- Take history and conduct physical examination\n- Complete clinical encounter form and MOH 257 (Green Card)\n- Manage any co-infection and co-morbidities\n- Review for potential drug interactions and contraindications\n- Conduct adherence assessment and review adherence support systems including daily witnessed ingestion plan\n- Reinforce patient education messages on new regimen\n- Currently limited future treatment options\n- Need for perfect adherence (>95%)\n- Dosing schedule and timing\n- Potential side effects and what the patient should do\n- Prescribe new regimen for 2 weeks\n- Confirm dosing as per the weight (for ≤15)\n- Continue other medication e.g., CPT, OI treatment etc.\n- Dispensing\n- Confirm ARV dosing as per the weight (for ≤15)\n- Conduct medication use counselling\n- Dispense 3ʳᵈ Line ARVs for 2 weeks\n- Check for possible drug interaction\n- Community follow up\n- Link all patients to support group, CHV/CHA\n- Plan for home visits as required\n\nAnnex 9 E: cont.\n\n# Patient Follow Up after Treatment Initiation\n\n# Frequency\n\n- First follow-up should be within 2 weeks of initiation of 3rd line ART\n- Subsequent visits should be monthly (or more frequent) until confirmed viral suppression at 6 months\n- Thereafter, follow-up can be 1-3 monthly\n\n# Triage\n\n- Record vital signs and take action as needed\n\n# Adherence Support\n\n- Adherence should be reinforced during every clinic visit, in addition to enhanced adherence counselling sessions\n- Review and address knowledge deficits on new regimen\n- Confirm understanding of adherence, conduct adherence assessment, and reinforce key adherence messages\n- Document reasons for missed doses and manage obstacles to perfect adherence.

Antiretroviral Therapy in Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults\n\nART, while very effective in managing HIV disease, does not cure HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress viral replication with the aim of reducing the patient's VL to undetectable levels. Uninterrupted ART with ongoing strict adherence will help maintain undetectable VL levels thereby preventing damage to the body's immune system, reducing AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and the risk of sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n## 6.1 Eligibility for ART\n\n| All individuals with confirmed HIV infection are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 count, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, co-infection status, risk group, or any other criteria. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n\n## 6.2 Timing of ART Initiation\n\nART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of confirmation of HIV status, and even on the same day as testing positive for HIV if they are ready.\n\nART Readiness Criteria (Table 5.4) can be used to help determine any issues that need to be addressed around the time of ART initiation. Same-day ART initiation (on the same day as testing HIV-positive) has additional benefits for HIV prevention (e.g., for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the HIV positive partner in a discordant relationship), and is associated with improved retention, viral suppression, and survival.

Home visits may also provide a better understanding of a patient’s living situation and specific barriers to adherence. Unscheduled home visits may be more revealing, but should only be conducted if the patient consented to home visits previously (preferably at the time of enrolment or initiation).\n\nAccurately assessing adherence requires clinicians to develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients. This is best done when one provider follows an individual patient longitudinally. The key to asking patients about their adherence is not in the specifics of the tool used but in taking the time to ask about adherence regularly and doing so in an open and truly inquisitive manner. Otherwise, many patients will simply state what they believe the clinician wants to hear: perfect adherence.\n\nEvery provider in each ART service delivery point should receive training and gain confidence in assessing adherence and providing adherence support and counselling to the majority of patients who do not have significant barriers to adherence. However, patients with significant adherence challenges and multiple barriers to adherence should be referred to providers with additional training and time to offer dedicated and enhanced adherence support and counselling. Involving experienced colleagues at the same health facility should be done as soon as a concern is identified, and the patient should be discussed by the MDT to generate as many solutions as possible. Consultation with Mental Health Teams or regional or national mentors may be required for complex situations.', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART', '- Religious beliefs: find out if the patient has tried faith healing, or if they have ever stopped taking their medicine because of their religious beliefs.\n\nAnnex 9A: Cont.\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Review the patient’s file to determine if they have been referred to other services. This includes referrals to social services, support groups, psychology services, nutrition services, medical clinics, substance abuse groups, etc.\n- Ask the patient if they attended the appointments, check in on their experience with the referral services and re-organize referrals as necessary.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to develop a plan that addresses each of the issues.

Enquire in a friendly way if any doses have been missed.\n- Review the patient’s barriers to adherence documented during the first session and if strategies identified have been taken up. If not, discuss why.\n\n# Identify Any New Issues\n\n- Discuss specific reasons why the patient may have missed their pills or a clinic appointment since the last counselling session, and determine if it is a new issue that wasn’t addressed during the first session.\n- Discuss if other issues have come up because of implementing the adherence plan (e.g., perhaps the disclosure process had unintended results).\n\n# Referrals and Networking\n\n- Follow-up on any referrals made during the previous session.\n- Determine if the patient could benefit from a home visit.\n\n# Develop Adherence Plan\n\n- Go through each of the adherence challenges identified during the session and assist the patient to modify their original adherence plan to address each of the issues. It is important to let the patient come up with the solutions so that they own them.\n- Give another short motivational speech on how you believe in the patient! You know they can do this! Together you will make sure that they suppress their viral load!!']","The recommended adherence strategies include:

1. **Monitoring Strategies:**
   - Use subjective methods like the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 and Scale-8 at every patient visit and when adherence issues are suspected.
   - Employ objective methods such as pill counts at every visit until viral suppression is confirmed, pharmacy refill records at every drug pick-up, and viral load monitoring based on specific timelines.

2. **Patient Interaction:**
   - Observe where and how patients store and take their medications.
   - Conduct home visits if necessary.
   - Develop a collaborative and non-judgmental relationship with patients.

3. **Adherence Support:**
   - Start adherence preparation, monitoring, and support at the time of HIV diagnosis and continue throughout ART follow-up.
   - Tailor adherence support strategies to the patient's adherence level, ART initiation stage, and follow-up stage.
   - Ensure follow-up is ideally provided by the same care provider or team, especially in the initial months of HIV care.

4. **Addressing Barriers:**
   - Consider referrals and networking to address barriers such as religious beliefs, socio-economic factors, and emotional barriers.

DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available', '# Table 6.10 Cont.\n\n1. If any drug in the recommended 2nd line regimen is contraindicated or previously not tolerated, consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform). Such patients may require DRT to select agents for the second-line ART. Additional drugs may be recommended on a case-by-case basis, including DRV/r, ATV/r, RAL, or ETR.\n2. Patients failing DTG-based or PI-based first-line regimens should have a Drug Resistance Test (DRT) ordered as soon as treatment failure is confirmed. The patient summary and DRT results should be sent to the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) or call Uliza Hotline (0726 460 000) to determine the most suitable second-line regimen for the patient. The DRT results will be used to determine if there is true DTG or PI failure or if there is an underlying problem with non-adherence. Daily witnessed ingestion is recommended prior to performing DRT.\n\n# Important Considerations for First-line Treatment Failure in Children\n\n- Second-line ART in infants and children is more complex to manage. These children and their caregivers should undergo thorough clinical and psychosocial assessment to rule out inter-current illness or non-adherence as the reason for a high viral load.\n- All children failing first-line should be discussed in the MDT and preferably with an experienced ART provider prior to change of ART to second-line. However, this should not cause undue delay in switching a failing regimen.\n- The choices for infants and children failing an alternative first-line regimen are limited and may need to be discussed with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG. Some of these children will require HIV DRT to determine the most suitable second-line regimen.\n\n# Important considerations for second-line ART Treatment Failure\n\n- Patients failing second-line ART have limited options. ARVs used to construct a third-line regimen are often more expensive, will have increased pill burden and more side effects. These factors will exacerbate pre-existing poor adherence.\n- Second-line treatment failure should be confirmed by viral load testing following the viral load monitoring algorithm (Figure 6.6).\n1. After the first detectable VL (≥ 50 copies/ml), assess for and address all causes of poor adherence, and assess for all other possible causes of viremia.\n2. These patients should be discussed at an MDT session. Repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence (preferably with daily witnessed ingestion of the ARVs by a treatment buddy, relative, CHV, etc.).\n3. If the second VL is still ≥ 50 copies/ml then continue the failing second-line regimen while reassessing adherence and other causes of viremia, implementing adherence support systems as needed, and then repeat the VL after another 3 months.\n4. If viremia continues then consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform) using the national case summary form (Annex 9B). These patients will likely require DRT in order for the TWG to design the most suitable third-line regimen.\n- Patients failing second-line ART require thorough assessment for barriers to adherence and ongoing enhanced adherence support including:\n- Assigning a case manager\n- More frequent adherence counselling by a trained counsellor\n- Assessment and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders']",The guideline excerpts provided do not directly address whether HIV can be managed with a two-drug regimen.,0.0,0.0,6.97,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
How do you handle treatment failure?,"['# Section 6: Treatment failure\n\n- What happens if you stop taking ART:\n- When you stop taking ART the virus begins to increase in your body very quickly\n- The virus goes back to the same high level it was at before you started ART\n- What happens if you do not take ART regularly:\n- The virus begins to increase to high levels again\n- What happens if the viral load increases:\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it will also affect your immunity and reduce your CD4 count putting you at risk of opportunistic infections\n- When the virus is allowed to increase again, it can change and get stronger, and becomes resistance to the ART\n- When the virus becomes resistant, the ART does not work against the virus anymore\n- The risk of resistance increases by not taking the ART correctly and by starting and stopping the medications several times\n- When resistance occurs, this is called treatment failure\n- What happens in treatment failure:\n- The ART no longer works because the virus has become resistant to it\n- If treatment fails, it is necessary to use stronger, more expensive ART, but it still may not work as well\n- With the stronger ART you may need to take more pills every day, and you may have more side effects\n- If you become resistant to the new ART as well, then there may not be any drugs that can work for you, and the virus will increase quickly and your CD4 count will go way down\n- It is essential that you take your ART every day as prescribed so that you do not develop treatment failure, and can live a long and healthy life\n\n# Section 7: ART side effects\n\n- What are the side-effects of ART:\n- Sometimes people can get side effects from taking ART\n- Side effects vary from person to person\n- Some people have none while other experience mild effects which are unpleasant but often manageable\n- Most side effects occur within the first few weeks of starting ART and then improve after a few weeks or months\n- Some common side effects include:\n- Headache\n- Loss of appetite\n- Skin rash\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\n- Muscle pains\n- What do you do if you notice any side effects:\n- If you develop any side effects, you should continue taking your ART as prescribed, without missing any doses, until you discuss with the clinician\n- If the side effects are mild then you can continue taking your ART without missing any doses, and then discuss the side effects with the clinician at your next appointment\n- If the side effects are bothering you too much then return to the clinic immediately, even if you do not have a scheduled appointment, to discuss what to do next; you can also call the clinic if you are not able to make it yourself immediately\n- Severe side effects include rash all over your body, or rash in your mouth or eyes, constant vomiting, inability to eat or retain food, or anything else that makes you think you should stop the ART. If this\n\n# Annex 8: Cont.\n\n# Section 8: Adherence\n\n- What is adherence\n- Following a care plan as agreed with the healthcare team\n- Attending clinic appointments as scheduled\n- Picking up medicines and taking them as prescribed\n- Getting lab tests according to the recommended schedule\n- Following nutritional recommendations\n- How should ART be taken\n- You must take the correct dosage. If you take less than the dose prescribed the treatment will not be effective and will result in resistance and treatment failure. Never share your ART with someone else\n- For children, the dosage keeps changing as they grow and gain weight\n- You must take ART at the correct time of day:\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken once per day, then pick a time when it will usually be convenient for you to remember, e.g., with breakfast every day.\n- If your ART is supposed to be taken twice per day, then you should set a convenient time to take your drugs approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., 8.00 am and 8.00 pm every day). It does not have to be exactly 12 hours apart if your schedule does not allow; the most important thing is to take them twice per day every day (e.g., you can take it at 6.00 am and 8.00 pm every day)\n- If you miss a dose of ART then take your dose as soon as you remember, as long as it is not within a couple of hours of your next dose, and then return to your regular schedule. Do not take a double-dose of ART to make up for a missed dose\n- You must take ART according to dietary restrictions. Some ART should be taken with food, for some it does not matter, and a few require that you have an empty stomach.', '# Annex 9 A: Enhanced Adherence Counselling Content Guide\n\n| Enhanced Adherence Counselling for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Treatment Failure<br/>Note: for children/adolescents, the script below should be modified towards the caregiver                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |\n| **Session 1**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n| * Assess patient\'s understanding of \'viral load\', \'high viral load\' and \'suppressed viral load\'.

There are several possible reasons for this such as problems with adherence, dosing of your medications, interactions with other drugs or foods, or possible drug resistance. It is very important for us to work with you determine which may apply to you.""\n* How does the patient feel concerning the result?\n* Explain the process of enhanced adherence:<br/>""Patients with a high viral load come for at least 3 adherence counselling sessions to discuss what might cause a high viral and to look for solutions on how adherence can be improved. Another viral load test will be done after 3 months of good adherence to see if the ART can be continued or if we need to change treatment.""\n* Check whether the patient had previous problems with adherence and/or missed appointments\n* Ask:<br/>""Why do you think your viral load is high?""\n* Sometimes the patient already knows why his/her VL is detectable. Start by giving them a chance to provide their own explanation. Often, they will admit that they are struggling with their adherence\n* If they really don\'t know why their VL is high you can say:<br/>""We notice that when people sometimes forget to take their ART everyday it gives the virus a chance to multiply.

For example, if the patient has chosen 9 pm, but is already asleep in bed by 9 pm, then that is not a good dosing time. If the time is a problem, then determine a new, more appropriate time with the patient based on their schedule.\n- Remind the patient/caregiver that a missed dose should be taken as soon as he/she remembers (up to a couple of hours before the next scheduled dose). The next dose should be taken at the usual time.\n- “What reminder tools do you use? (e.g., mobile phone alarm)”\n- “What do you do in case of visits, and travel?”\n- Travelling is always a risk for poor adherence or default from treatment. Encourage the patient to plan, to make sure they have enough medication on hand before and to remember to pack it.\n- Make sure that all relevant information is on the patient’s appointment card and explain that if they are ever away from home and they are about to run out of medication that they must go to the closest ART clinic and show their appointment card.\n- “What do you do in case of side effects?”\n- Ask the patient if s/he has any side effects from the ARVs, and if they sometimes find it difficult to take ARVs.\n- Due to the side effects, ask how s/he manages side effects and if it influences the way s/he takes the drugs.\n- “What are the most difficult situations for you to take drugs?”\n- Check for alcohol or drug use. Ask the patient in a casual way (not in an accusing way) if they sometimes use substances; emphasize treatment planning in case they do.', ""# Annex 9 B: Case Summary Form\n\n![Coat of arms of

When is regimen switching appropriate?,"['Adherence support systems will need to be adapted to patients’ specific needs and the context (Table 5.18). Special attention needs to be given to children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients with mental health disorders and substance users.\n\n# 5.6 Treatment Preparation for 2nd Line or 3rd Line ART\n\nAfter confirming treatment failure and making the decision to start 2nd line or 3rd line ART (based on discussion as an MDT, and in consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG), the patient requires targeted counselling and education to prepare them for the new regimen and to support ongoing adherence (Figure 5.2).\n\n- Review the patient file\n- Review patient file\n- Confirm all the barriers to adherence have been addressed during Enhanced Adherence Counselling, if not – address remaining barriers before considering changing regimens\n- Assess patient’s knowledge and understanding\n- HIV, viral load and ART\n- The importance of good adherence and potential problems of non-adherence\n- Reasons for switching to 2nd or 3rd line ART: treatment failure with repeated high viral load\n- Provide patient education\n- Strengthen key messages on HIV and viral load\n- Provide information on 2nd/3rd line ART: more complex to take (more pills, twice-a-day dosing), very limited options if this fails\n- Provide simple take-home IEC materials on 2nd or 3rd line ART management\n- Construct adherence plan\n- Confirm patient’s willingness to start new regimen\n- Ensure that the patient understands the treatment plan (drug regimen, dosing schedule, dietary restrictions, potential side effects, what to do when missing doses or experiencing side effects)\n- Prepare for situations that could impair good adherence, and encourage disclosure of poor adherence\n- Plan sessions with the pharmacist on medication adherence, and nutritionist on nutritional aspects\n\nEnsure a monthly follow-up counselling session during clinic visits for the first 6 months after initiating the new regimen\n\n- Ensure monthly counselling follow-up sessions\n- Follow up on problems identified during the previous sessions\n- Assess patient’s adherence and explore any reasons for poor adherence. Identify strategies to overcome these barriers\n- Repeat VL after 3 months on new regimen\n- If VL undetectable: adherence counselling every 3 months\n- If VL is detectable: discuss as MDT and consult Clinical TWG', '# 5. Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support\n\nThe individual and population benefits of ART are dependent on high levels of adherence to the prescribed medication, the accompanying medical advice and the follow-up plans. Adherence-enhancing strategies should be implemented beginning at the point of HIV diagnosis (as part of post-test counselling and linkage), continued during initial evaluation, and thereafter during the entire follow-up period for ART.\n\nTo avoid treatment failure and the need to switch patients to 2nd or 3rd line ART, it is key to have an adherence support strategy in place before ART initiation, anticipating common and individual barriers to good adherence. Prevention of treatment failure starts at the time of HIV diagnosis. This is particularly important with the current recommendation that all PLHIV qualify for ART, and ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Adherence preparation must begin at time of HIV testing, and close follow-up is required after ART initiation.\n\nThe adherence preparation, monitoring, and support that a patient requires should be tailored to their level of adherence, the stage of ART initiation, and the follow-up stage that they are at (Figure 5.1).\n\nWhenever possible, follow-up should be provided by the same care provider or team of care providers (e.g., same clinician and same counsellor) at each visit. This is particularly important during the first few months of HIV care.\n\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HTS post-test counselling: key treatment preparation messages for all patients who test positive<br>• Treatment is available and recommended for everyone with HIV<br>• Starting treatment early reduces your chance of becoming ill or infecting your sexual partner(s)<br>• With good adherence you can live a long and productive life] --> B[Enrolment Visit<br>• HIV education and adherence preparation for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.1)<br>• ART Readiness Assessment for all patients/caregivers (Table 5.4), along with<br>  individualized adherence support plan]\n    B --> C[Ready to start ART]\n    B --> D[Not ready to start ART]\n    C --> E[• Initiate ART<br>• Baseline investigations if not already completed<br>• Provide standard package of care and differentiated<br>  care based on initial presentation (advanced disease vs<br>  well)<br>• Book follow-up appointment for week 2 and 4 to<br>  review adherence and side-effects<br>• Continue adherence support plan]\n    D --> F[• Weekly appointments to review clinical<br>  status, barriers to ART initiation, and provide<br>  ongoing HIV education and counselling<br>• Provide standard package of care<br>• Re-assessment of ART readiness at every<br>  visit, until ready (target is within 2 weeks)]\n    E --> G[Follow-up with adherence monitoring at every<br>visit (Table 5.10) and counselling based on<br>level of adherence (Table 5.14) until first VL at<br>3 months]\n    F --> C\n    G --> H[VL undetectable (LDL <200copies/ml )<br>• Ongoing adherence assessment and<br>  counselling (Table 5.16)<br>• Continue routine VL monitoring as per<br>  the population group]\n    G --> I[VL ≥ 200 copies/ml<br>• Suspect poor adherence<br>• Assess for barriers to adherence (Table 5.15)<br>• Follow VL algorithm with enhanced<br>  adherence assessment and interventions and<br>  assessment for other causes of viremia<br>  (Figure 6.6)]\n```\n\nFigure 5.1: Adherence Preparation, Monitoring and Support until Viral Load after 3 Months on ART', '# Adherence Challenges in Treatment\n\nAdherence is most difficult during the first few months of treatment: the patient is not yet in the habit of taking their medications every day, they are not familiar with common side-effects, and they have more challenges with disclosure and stigma, all of which can interfere with adherence. Poor adherence within the first few months of therapy is also the most risky period for development of resistance mutations, when the viral load is still high.\n\nFor these reasons, adherence preparation, monitoring and support must be emphasized during the first few months of ART until the patient achieves full virological suppression, after which adherence monitoring and support can continue at lower intensity.\n\n# Patient Preparation and Counselling\n\nPatient preparation and counselling should be a collaborative process between the provider and the patient or caregiver, to enable the patient to initiate and continue lifelong treatment. This is best done when the same adherence counsellor follows an individual patient throughout the preparation, initiation, and early ART period.\n\nART can be initiated concurrently with the first adherence counselling session, even during the enrolment visit, especially for infants and for pregnant women. This may also apply to patients with a good understanding of HIV and ART and strong motivation for immediate ART initiation.\n\n# Multidisciplinary Team Support\n\nEach member of the multidisciplinary team should have the requisite training to provide treatment education and offer appropriate support to address potential barriers to adherence. Treatment preparation and support can be offered at triage, consultation, pharmacy or any other clinic station where confidentiality and privacy are assured and providers are adequately trained. It should also be incorporated into health talks, peer support group activities, and group counselling sessions.\n\nBefore commencement of a counseling session, the counselor should ensure that adequate space is available to conduct the counseling, that confidentiality can be maintained, and that tools such as psychosocial assessment forms, treatment literacy flip charts, PHDP flip charts, and tools to document the counseling sessions are available.\n\n\n\n\n# Operational Guidance: Meaningful Involvement of People Living with HIV\n\nPersons living positively (adolescent and adult peer educators who can share personal experiences when needed) should be engaged to support patient education as indicated in the operational guidance below.\n\nFor best patient outcomes, PLHIV themselves should be engaged to lead facility-based and community-based HIV education and support systems. They are often referred to as “peer educators”, “mentor mothers”, and “lay health workers” in these roles. PLHIV have successfully and significantly contributed to: improving identification of people at risk for HIV or infected with HIV; increasing linkage from testing to treatment; reducing onward transmission of HIV; providing psychosocial support, and improving adherence and retention to care and ART.\n\n# Identifying PLHIV to offer peer-led patient support:\n\n- PLHIV on ART for ≥ 1 year\n- Good adherence and undetectable VL\n- Positive attitude and interest in supporting peers\n\n# Preparing and supporting PLHIV to play a role in patient support systems:\n\n- Must be trained for the role they are expected to provide\n- Must have job aids and IEC material appropriate for their role\n- Must be supervised by healthcare professionals\n\n# Potential roles for PLHIV include:\n\n- Supporting HIV self-testing\n- Providing HIV testing services\n- Acting as peer linkage supporters\n- Leading or contributing to facility-based or community-based support groups\n- Providing individual or group HIV education\n- Providing individual or group adherence counselling\n- Distribution of ART refills for stable patients\n\n# Compensation for PLHIV who contribute to patient support systems:\n\n- Recognition (e.g., ID badges; certificates of service; acknowledgement at community forums)\n- Training opportunities with certification\n- Financial compensation (e.g., salaries; stipends; transportation allowances)\n- Priority consideration for employment opportunities\n\n\n\n# 5.1 Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)\n\nART adherence resulting to durable viral suppression eliminates risk of sexual transmission of HIV and is key to HIV epidemic control. Adoption of the Undetectable equals Untransmittable (U=U) campaign is posed to revolutionize HIV treatment among PLHIV and fortify treatment-for-prevention strategies. Multiple studies have showed that durable viral suppression of &#x3C;50 copies/ml eliminates risk of sexual transmission of HIV. (Table 5.17 Viral load cut-offs)\n\nThe framework of U=U offers a unique opportunity to dismantle HIV stigma and discrimination, emphasizes the critical importance of antiretroviral therapy (ART), daily adherence, and continuous engagement in medical care for PLHIV.\n\n# Definitions:\n\n- Durably Undetectable: 2 consecutive viral load results of &#x3C;50 copies/ml\n- Untransmittable: The finding established by various clinical trials and observational studies, that people who maintain an undetectable viral load have minimal HIV virus in their blood and other body fluids secretions that they have “effectively no risk” of passing HIV to others through sex.']","Regimen switching is appropriate when treatment failure is confirmed, and the decision to start 2nd or 3rd line ART is made after discussion with a multidisciplinary team and consultation with the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG.",1.0,0.9599765774081557,6.9,cosine,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
What is the role of resistance testing?,"['# 1. Summary of Key Recommendations\n\n## 1.1 HIV Testing Services (HTS) and Linkage to Treatment and Prevention\n\n- HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results, Connection (linkage) and Creating an enabling environment can be assured\n\n- To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in 2 different settings:\n  - Facility-based\n  - Community-based\n\n- Targeted HIV testing is recommended which involves index client listing of contacts, HIV self-testing and use of HTS screening tool to identify people at risk of HIV infection as eligible for testing\n\n- Serial testing, using approved rapid HIV antibody testing kits, is used to diagnose HIV infection in children older than 18 months, adolescents, and adults. An HIV-positive diagnosis will be made using three consecutive reactive assays\n\n## 1.2 Initial Evaluation and Follow-up for PLHIV\n\n- Initial clinical evaluation of PLHIV entails CD4 monitoring, which is recommended for:\n  - Baseline investigation for all PLHIV\n  - Any patient with suspected treatment failure\n  - Any patient returning to care after interrupting treatment for >3 months\n  - Any patient on fluconazole maintenance therapy or on dapsone as prophylaxis, to determine when prophylaxis can be discontinued\n\n- Advanced HIV Disease is defined as:\n  - Adults, adolescents, and children five years and older as having a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm³ or\n  - WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease\n  - All children younger than five years\n\n- All PLHIV presenting with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) should be offered a package of care that includes timely initiation of ART, screening, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and management of opportunistic infections.\n\n- Frequency of routine VL monitoring:\n  - For PCR positive HEIs: at baseline (at the time of ART initiation)\n  - Age 0-24 years old: 3 months after ART initiation, and then every 6 months\n\n\n▪ Pregnant or breastfeeding: at confirmation of pregnancy (if already on ART) or 3 months after ART initiation (if ART initiated during pregnancy/breastfeeding), and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding\n\n▪ Before any drug substitution (if no VL result available from the prior 6 months)\n\n▪ Three months after any regimen modification (including single-drug substitution)\n\n● PLHIV should receive differentiated care based on initial evaluation (advanced vs. well) and follow up (established vs not established on ART)\n\n# 1.3 Standard Package of Care for PLHIV\n\nConsists of 8 components:\n\n1. Antiretroviral Therapy\n- All PLHIV are eligible for ART irrespective of CD4 cell count or percentage, WHO clinical stage, age, pregnancy status, or comorbidities\n- ART should be initiated as soon as the patient is ready to start, preferably within two weeks from time of HIV diagnosis (except for patients with cryptococcal meningitis or TB meningitis)\n2. Positive Health, Dignity, and Prevention, GBV/IPV &#x26; HIV Education and Counselling\n- All patients should be counselled and supported for disclosure of HIV status; partner/ family testing and engagement; condom use; family planning; sexually transmitted infections screening; treatment adherence; and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-negative sexual partners\n- All females aged 15-49 years and emancipated minors accessing HIV care services should be screened for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as part of the standard package of care\n- All PLHIV should be provided with HIV education and counselling\n3. Screening for and Prevention of Specific Opportunistic Infections\nCotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) is no longer recommended as life-long prophylaxis, and is only recommended in the following sub populations, unless they have an allergy to sulfur drugs or develop toxicity from CPT:\n\n- All HIV Exposed Infants\n- HIV infected children &#x3C; 15 years of age\n- All PLHIV > 15 years of age:\n- Living in malaria-endemic zones (Refer to the National Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Malaria in Kenya for the current Kenya Malaria endemicity map)\n- Presenting with WHO stage 3 or 4 event, or meeting the AHD criteria\n- Suspected treatment failure\n- All Pregnant and Breast-feeding women', '# Kenya HIV Prevention and Treatment Guidelines, 2022\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Gene Xpert Results] --> B[MTB Detected Rifampicin Resistance Detected RR]\n    A --> C[MTB Detected Rifampicin Resistance not Detected TR]\n    A --> D[MTB not Detected N]\n    A --> E[MTB Detected₁ Rifampicin Resistance inditerminate TI]\n    A --> F[MTB Detected Trace⁴]\n    A --> G[Invalid/ Error]\n\n    B --> B1[1.
