# Clinician Assistant LG

A conversational assistant designed to help clinicians in Kenya access patient data and clinical guidelines efficiently. This project uses LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI models to provide context-aware, tool-augmented chat for clinical decision support.

---

## Features

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Retrieve relevant HIV clinical guidelines using natural language queries.
- **SQL Chain:** Query and summarize patient data from a structured database.
- **IDSR Check:** Analyze clinical cases for possible notifiable diseases and suggest clarifying questions.
- **PHI Filtering:** Detect and filter personally identifiable information from free text.
- **Session Management:** Supports persistent chat sessions with unique thread IDs.
- **Gradio UI:** Simple web interface for clinicians to interact with the assistant.
