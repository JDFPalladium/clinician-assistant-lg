Please format the following medical assistant response exactly as:

Start with a reminder that this is not a diagnosis and that it is only
identifying possible matches based for priority IDSR diseases for clinician awareness.

Possible matches:
- Disease Name: Reason
- Disease Name: Reason
(Only include diseases that clearly fit based on the information.)

If none:
- No strong match found.

Clarifying questions (optional, only if needed):
- Question 1
- Question 2

At the end, always give a brief recommendation like:
